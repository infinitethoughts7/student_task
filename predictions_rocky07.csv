More research is needed about whether and how additional screening might help women with dense breasts stay healthy, as well as the benefits and harms of screening in women older than age 75. The use of the term “women” in this recommendation includes cisgender women and other people assigned female at birth. Although the USPSTF has consistently recognized the value of mammography, it had previously recommended that women in their 40s make an individual decision about when to start breast cancer screening based on their health history and preferences. In this new recommendation—published in JAMA and also available at uspstf.org—the USPSTF now recommends that all women undergo screening for breast cancer starting at age 40.1 Fundamentally, this is a shift from recommending that women start screening between the ages of 40 and 50 years to recommending that all women start screening when they turn 40. Wanda Nicholson, MD, MPH, MBA “More women in their 40s have been getting breast cancer, with rates increasing about 2% each year, so this recommendation will make a big difference for people across the country,” said Task Force Chair Wanda Nicholson, MD, MPH, MBA, Senior Associate Dean for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and Professor of Prevention and Community Health at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at the George Washington University. “By starting to screen all women at age 40, we can save nearly 20% more lives from breast cancer overall. This new approach has even greater potential benefit for Black women, who are much more likely to die of breast cancer.” Addressing Health Disparities Ensuring Black women start screening at age 40 is an important first step, yet it is not enough to improve the existing inequities. “We need to know how best to address the health disparities related to breast John Wong, MD cancer, so all women can live longer and healthier lives,” said Task Force Vice Chair John Wong, MD, Vice Chair for Academic Affairs, Chief of the Division of Clinical Decision Making, and Professor of Medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine. “Clinicians must help reduce any barriers to patients getting the recommended screening; timely, equitable, and appropriate follow-up; and effective treatment of breast cancer.” More Research Is Essential There are many key areas where more research is essential. Some examples include improving health equity across breast cancer screening and treatment, so that those experiencing disparities related to structural racism, lack of access to care in rural and other communities, low incomes, or other factors associated with the risk for breast cancer death can be helped. More research on the benefits and harms of breast cancer screening and treatment in women aged 75 and older is also warranted; the balance of benefits and harms may shift as women age, but there is limited research on this group. Additionally, nearly half of all women have dense breasts, which increases their risk for breast cancer and means mammography may not work as well for them. More studies that show how additional screening with breast ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging might help women with dense breasts are needed. “Women deserve to have the best science available to guide them on how to protect their health, and we’re asking the research community to prioritize studies that can show us how best to screen for breast cancer in women with dense breasts,” said Dr. Nicholson. “In the meantime, women with dense breasts should talk with their clinician about options for follow-up testing, so they can get the care that’s right for them.” The USPSTF’s recommendation applies to women at average risk of breast cancer, as well as those who have a family history of breast cancer and those with dense breasts. The recommendation does not apply to people who have a personal history of breast cancer, who are at very high risk of breast cancer because of certain genetic markers or a history of high-dose radiation therapy to their chest at a young age, or who have had a high-risk lesion on previous biopsies.

1,Ascopost_267_Q2_2024,Media," Dennis J. Slamon, MD, PhD, Awarded 2024 Szent-Györgyi Prize for Progress in Cancer Research","Dennis J. Slamon, MD, PhD, Awarded 2024 Szent-Györgyi Prize for Progress in Cancer Research The National Foundation for Cancer Research (NFCR) announced that the blue-ribbon selection committee, composed of world-renowned research leaders and visionaries, has awarded the 2024 Szent-Györgyi Prize for Progress in Cancer Research to Dennis J. Slamon, MD, PhD, of UCLA Health, for his groundbreaking research discoveries that helped to shape the field of precision medicine for patients with breast cancer. The cancer research community will celebrate Dr. Slamon and his accomplishments on October 18, 2024, at the Szent-Györgyi Prize Dinner and Award Ceremony, taking place during NFCR's Global Summit and Award Ceremonies for Cancer Research and Entrepreneurship in Washington, DC, at The National Press Club. Dennis J. Slamon, MD, PhD ""I am truly honored and humbled to be selected by the committee for the coveted Szent-Györgyi Prize,"" said Dr. Slamon. ""From bench to bedside, my mission from day one has always been to improve the lives of cancer patients. To be recognized by my peers and awarded this prize by the NFCR is a defining moment for me and will serve as inspiration to continue my research, fight for patients, and continue to challenge conventional thinking by consistently redefining what's possible as it relates to medical and treatment advancements against cancer."" Dr. Slamon’s Research For decades, Dr. Slamon has relentlessly focused on pioneering cancer research and the development of novel therapies for breast cancer. In 1987, he discovered that the amplification of the growth-promoting HER2 gene led to the pathologic overexpression of the gene product and its association with 25% to 30% of human breast cancer cases. This alteration—a noninherited mutation—defined a new subtype of breast cancer. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, there was much resistance to Dr. Slamon's research, as it represented a completely new way of thinking. Previously, cancers from the same organ with similar histology were presumed to be—and largely treated as—the same. His work showed that pathogenic molecular mechanisms could differ in cancers yet look the same under the microscope. With unwavering determination and persistence, Dr. Slamon then demonstrated that antibodies targeting the HER2 receptors inhibited the growth of the cells in vitro and in vivo. Dr. Slamon played an instrumental role in the clinical development of HER2-targeted antibodies, from preclinical studies to the proof-of-concept early clinical work to the eventual U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of trastuzumab. Since trastuzumab’s approval in 1998, it has been used to treat nearly 3 million patients with HER2-positive breast cancer worldwide. Dr. Slamon's therapeutic approach has completely reversed the natural history of HER2-positive breast cancers for patients with the worst to those with the best prognosis. Based on lessons from trastuzumab, he created a new paradigm of thinking for developing new cancer treatments. Targeting the molecular mechanism, not the histology, became the basis for most new cancer treatments across many cancer types. Another significant discovery by Dr. Slamon revealed that estrogen receptor–positive, HER2-negative breast cancers—which account for 65% of breast cancer diagnoses—are uniquely sensitive to inhibitors of enzymes crucial to cell division, the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6. This discovery and his translational research led to clinical trials and the 2015 approval of the initial targeted inhibitor of CDK4/6, palbociclib, significantly improving the prognosis for the most common type of high-risk breast cancer. To this day, Dr. Slamon continues to investigate mechanisms of resistance to HER2-targeted therapies and is investigating the biology of other breast cancer subtypes for clinical translation. Chair of the 2024 Selection Committee and 2023 Szent-Györgyi Prize Winner, Isaac Witz, PhD, remarked, “I can think of none finer to receive the 2024 Szent Györgyi Prize than Dr. Slamon. The scientific and medical advances he has made for women with breast cancer have created a new paradigm for treatment options and resulting survival rates. I have known of Dr. Slamon’s research for some time and have sincerely admired his approaches, how he thinks differently than others in the field, and his tenacity to tackle the clinical trial process head-on to produce results for patients.” Sujuan Ba, PhD, NFCR's President and Chief Executive Officer and the Co-Chair of the 2024 Szent-Györgyi Prize Selection Committee, added, ""Dr. Slamon epitomizes our vision of a Szent-Györgyi Prize winner. One of my favorite quotes from our co-founder Albert Szent-Györgyi is ‘to see what others have seen but to think differently than anybody else has thought.’ Dr. Slamon has done just this through his research around the amplification of the HER2 gene, which shed even more light on cancer being a genetic disease and paved the way for a completely new set of targeted treatments for breast cancer patients. Over time, as his research produced more and more positive results…, many of his research and medical peers began to adopt the viewpoint of ‘breast cancer before Dennis and after Dennis.’ We could not be more proud to have Dr. Slamon as our 2024 Szent-Györgyi Prize winner.” Current Roles and Education Currently, Dr. Slamon serves as Director of Clinical/Translational Research and as Director of the Revlon/UCLA Women's Cancer Research Program at the Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center. He is a Professor of Medicine, Chief of the Division of Hematology/Oncology, and Executive Vice Chair for Research for UCLA's Department of Medicine. Dr. Slamon also serves as Director of the medical advisory board for the National Colorectal Cancer Research Alliance. A 1975 honors graduate of the University of Chicago's Pritzker School of Medicine, Dr. Slamon earned his PhD in cell biology that same year. He completed his internship and residency at the University of Chicago Hospitals and Clinics, becoming chief resident in 1978. One year later, he became a fellow in the Division of Hematology/Oncology at UCLA. In acknowledgement of his accomplishments, President Clinton appointed Dr. Slamon to the three-member President's Cancer Panel in June 2000.The National Foundation for Cancer Research (NFCR) announced that the blue-ribbon selection committee, composed of world-renowned research leaders and visionaries, has awarded the 2024 Szent-Györgyi Prize for Progress in Cancer Research to Dennis J.

""In the rapidly evolving treatment landscape, these results provide additional support for [nivolumab] plus [gemcitabine-cisplatin] as a first-line treatment option in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma,"" according to Guru Sonpavde, MD. Investigators reported statistically significant and clinically meaningful overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) improvements in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma when combining nivolumab (Opdivo) with gemcitabine/cisplatin as frontline therapy, according to data from the phase 3 CheckMate-901 study (NCT03036098) presented at the American Urological Association (AUA) 2024 Annual Meeting.1 The treatment combination was approved by the FDA in March 2024 based on the results of CheckMate-901.2 “Cisplatin based chemotherapy has been the first-line standard of care for eligible patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma for decades.3-5 Although avelumab (Bavencio) has shown a survival benefit as maintenance therapy, only the subset of patients who do not have disease progression with first-line platinum-based chemotherapy are eligible.6,7 For the phase 3 CheckMate-901 trial, we evaluated up-front combination therapy with nivolumab plus gemcitabine cisplatin…followed by nivolumab monotherapy vs [gemcitabine-cisplatin] alone in eligible patients with previously untreated, advanced urothelial carcinoma,”8 said presenting author Guru Sonpavde, MD, medical director of Genitourinary Oncology, assistant director of the Clinical Research Unit and Christopher K. Glanz Chair for Bladder Cancer Research at the AdventHealth Cancer Institute in Orlando, Florida. Patients 18 years of age or older with previously untreated, resectable or metastastic urothelial carcinoma involving the renal pelvis, ureter, bladder, or urethra who were cisplatin eligible and with an ECOG Performance Status of 0-1 were eligible for inclusion in the study. Participants “received [nivolumab] 360 mg plus [gemcitabine-cisplatin] every 3 [weeks] for up to 6 cycles followed by [nivolumab] 480 mg every 4 [weeks] until disease progression/unacceptable toxicity or up to a maximum of 2 years, or gemcitabine-cisplatin every 3 [weeks] for up to 6 cycles,” the investigators wrote. The primary end points were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) per blinded independent central review. Key secondary end points included OS and PFS by PD-L1 of 1 or greater and health-related quality of life. Median study follow-up was 33.6 months (range, 7.4-62.4 months). A total of 304 patients were randomly assigned to each arm. The investigators reported a median OS of 21.7 months (95% CI, 18.6-26.4) in the nivolumab plus gemcitabine-cisplatin arm compared with 18.9 months in the gemcitabine-cisplatin arm (95% CI, 14.7-22.4) (P = .0171). Median PFS per blinded independent central review was 7.9 months (95% CI, 7.6-9.5) in the nivolumab plus gemcitabine-cisplatin arm vs 7.6 months (95% CI, 6.1-7.8) in the gemcitabine-cisplatin arm. In the nivolumab plus gemcitabine-cisplatin arm, 84% of patients had a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in sum of diameter of target lesions per blinded independent central review in all responders, 48% had a 75% or greater reduction, and 28% had a 90% or greater reduction. In the gemcitabine-cisplatin arm, 80% had a 50% or greater reduction, 40% had a 75% or greater reduction, and 20% had a 90% or greater reduction. Any-grade adverse events (AEs) were observed in 97 patients in the nivolumab plus gemcitabine-cisplatin arm vs 93 in the gemcitabine-cisplatin alone arm. Grade 3 or higher AEs were seen in 62 patients in the nivolumab plus gemcitabine-cisplatin arm vs 52 in the gemcitabine-cisplatin arm. “To summarize, [nivolumab] plus [gemcitabine-cisplatin] showed significant and clinically meaningful benefit in OS, PFS, and response over [gemcitabine-cisplatin] alone. As first-line treatment in advanced urothelial carcinoma, the CR rate approximately doubled for [nivolumab] plus [gemcitabine-cisplatin] to 21.7%, with a median duration of CR of 37.1 months. These benefits were attained with a finite duration of chemotherapy, up to 6 cycles, and a maximum of 2 years of nivolumab. Analyses further characterizing patients who responded are warranted, especially in those who achieved CR. The safety in the responders was consistent with data in the ITT overall population.8 In the rapidly evolving treatment landscape, these results provide additional support for [nivolumab] plus [gemcitabine-cisplatin] as a first-line treatment option in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma,” Sonpavde said.","Nivolumab Combo Significantly Boosts Survival in Urothelial Carcinoma Findings from the CheckMate-901 study support the use of frontline nivolumab plus gemcitabine/cisplatin in advanced urothelial carcinoma.

The current findings follow those from the IMpassion130 trial, which showed that the combination of atezolizumab with nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy offered no survival benefit in previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic TNBC despite a progression-free survival benefit on interim analysis.Rapidly relapsing TNBC ""represents one of most challenging clinical situations"" because it is aggressive and ""intrinsically resistant to standard therapies,"" said Dent. It is also more common in younger patients with large primary tumors and no BRCA alterations.""Most importantly, however, is that most trials actually exclude these patients,"" she noted, ""posing a real challenge for us in clinical practice.""IMpassion132 enrolled 594 patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC who had experienced disease progression more than 12 months after their last treatment for early TNBC with curative intent.Patients had received prior anthracycline and taxane therapy for but no prior chemotherapy for advanced disease.Study participants were randomly assigned to chemotherapy with carboplatin-gemcitabine or capecitabine plus atezolizumab or placebo, with treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was overall survival.Initially, all patients with TNBC who met the study criteria were enrolled in the randomized, phase 3, double-blinded trial; however, the trial was then amended to include only PD-L1–positive patients after the results of IMpassion130 ""clearly showed us that the benefits of immune checkpoint inhibition were largely driven by those patients,"" Dent explained.The 354 patients with PD-L1–positive disease were ""young,"" she added, with a median age of 48 years. The youngest was 23 years old.The majority (66%-69%) had a disease-free interval of less than 6 months after treatment with curative intent. Lung and/or liver metastases were present in 60%-62% of patients, and 18% had previously received platinum-based chemotherapy.After a median follow-up of 9.8 months, overall survival was a median of 12.1 months in the atezolizumab group vs 11.2 months with placebo, at a hazard ratio of 0.93 (P =.59).A similar result was seen when looking at the modified intention-to-treat population, and when stratifying the patients by prespecified subgroup.Dent pointed out that in the placebo group, patients treated with capecitabine had a median overall survival of 12.6 months vs 9.9 months in those given carboplatin-gemcitabine , which she described as ""hypothesis generating"" because ""prior therapy may trigger a variety of resistance mechanisms.""The disease-free interval also seemed to play a role in the placebo group. Patients who had a disease-free interval of 6 or more months prior to study enrolment had a median overall survival of 12.8 months vs 9.4 months in those with an interval of less than 6 months.There were no significant differences in progression-free survival or duration of overall response between the atezolizumab and placebo groups.""In terms of the safety data, clearly we're getting better at identifying immune checkpoint inhibition toxicities and initiating therapies for these toxicities earlier,"" Dent said, because there were ""no new safety signals.""The rate of treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events was similar between patients given atezolizumab and those assigned to placebo, at 65% vs 62%. Rates of grade 5 events were identical, at 1%.Commenting on the study, Sara M. Tolaney, MD, MPH, chief, Division of Breast Oncology, Susan F. Smith Center for Women's Cancers, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, questioned the role for immunotherapy in patients with TNBC who experience early relapse. This is not the first trial to fail to show a benefit in this space, she said. Collectively, these results make ""me think that these tumors are pretty immunologically cold, making them less likely to benefit from checkpoint inhibition."" The patients that do relapse, ""have highly treatment refractory disease,"" and ""we need to think about other novel therapeutic strategies for this population,"" she told Medscape Medical News.IMpassion132 nevertheless represents a ""unique opportunity to better understand the biology of these rapidly relapsing tumors, and hopefully use this information to develop more novel treatment approaches for this population,"" she said.""That being said, I do think that this is going to become an even more challenging area,"" Tolaney said.

4,MedScape_98_Q2_2024,Media,"ADCs for Breast Cancer: Clear Benefits, Manageable Risks","ADCs for Breast Cancer: Clear Benefits, Manageable Risks Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) — a class of targeted medications that combine monoclonal antibodies with cytotoxic payloads — are rapidly changing the treatment landscape for patients with metastatic breast cancer.These medications, which are designed to selectively deliver potent cytotoxic drugs to cancer cells expressing specific surface antigens such as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2), can be highly effective but can also come with significant toxicities.The latest data on several ADCs — their clinical benefit and safety — were the focus of three presentations here at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Breast Cancer 2024 Annual Congress.TROPION-Breast01In her presentation, Komal Jhaveri, MD, with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, reported additional safety analyses from the phase 3 TROPION-Breast01 trial looking at datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) in patients with metastatic hormone receptor–positive (HR+)/HER2− breast cancer resistant to endocrine therapy.Dato-DXd is an investigational ADC composed of a monoclonal antibody targeting TROP2, a transmembrane glycoprotein overexpressed in cancer cells, linked to the topoisomerase 1 inhibitor deruxtecan as the toxic payload.As previously reported by Medscape Medical News, median progression-free survival was 6.9 months with Dato-DXd compared with 4.9 months for investigator's choice of chemotherapy (eribulin mesylate, vinorelbine, gemcitabine, or capecitabine), which translated into a 37% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63; P < .0001) reduction in risk for disease progression.In addition, the rate of grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events with Dato-DXd was less than half that with standard chemotherapy and led to fewer dose interruptions or reductions, indicating that Dato-DXd is better tolerated.Jhaveri focused on three treatment-related adverse events of special interest: Stomatitis/oral mucositis, ocular surface events, and adjudicated drug-related interstitial lung disease.The rate of any grade oral mucositis with Dato-DXd was 56%, she reported. Most were grade 1 (25%) or grade 2 (23%), with only 7% grade 3. About 13% of patients had a dose reduction for oral mucositis, and only one (0.3%) patient discontinued treatment.The median time to onset was 22 days, and median time to resolution (for events recovered/resolved at data cutoff) was 36 days.""The study did provide toxicity management guidelines for patients who experienced stomatitis,"" Jhaveri told attendees. The guidelines highly recommended daily use of a steroid-containing mouthwash as prophylaxis or, if that wasn't available, an inert, bland mouth rinse.""Prophylactic cryotherapy — ice chips or ice water held in the mouth throughout the infusion — was also suggested,"" she said.The overall rate of ocular surface events with Dato-DXd was 40%, with most grade 1 (32%) or grade 2 (7%), with only 0.8% grade 3. Rates of dose reduction/interruption (3.3%) and discontinuation (0.3%) were low. Most ocular events were either dry eye (22%) or keratitis (14%).The incidence of ocular events in the chemotherapy group was 12%, higher than typically seen. The study mandated regular ocular assessments, and Jhaveri noted that it was possible that this contributed to the high rate of low-grade ocular events found in both arms.Median time to onset of ocular events was 65 days, and median time to resolution was 67 days.Toxicity management guidelines were also incorporated for ocular events, suggesting daily use of artificial tears and avoidance of contact lenses, Jhaveri said.In the Dato-DXd group, there were 12 adjudicated cases (3.3%) of drug-related interstitial lung disease; most were grade 1 (1.4%) and grade 2 (1.1%).""There was one patient who had a grade 5 event, which was characterized by the investigator as grade 3 pneumonitis, with death attributed to disease progression,"" Jhaveri said. This was subsequently adjudicated to be a grade 5 drug-related death.The median time to onset of interstitial lung disease was 84.5 days, and median time to resolution was 28 days.Among other treatment-related adverse events of clinical interest, any grade nausea was the most common event with Dato-DXd, reported by 51% of patients, with only 1.4% grade 3 or higher.""Prophylactic antiemetic agents are highly recommended prior to infusion of Dato-DXd and on subsequent days as needed,"" Jhaveri said.Any grade diarrhea was reported in 7.5%, with no grade 3+ diarrhea. Alopecia was reported in 36.4%, of which grade 1 was 21% and grade 2 was 15%.Summing up, the researcher said the new safety data suggest that Dato-DXd offers ""better tolerability"" than standard chemotherapy. Coupled with the efficacy data, this further supports ""Dato-DXd as a potential new therapeutic option for patients with previously treated, inoperable, or metastatic HR+/HER2− breast cancer.""DESTINY-Breast02New data from the phase 3 DESTINY-Breast02 study confirm a long-term survival benefit, as well as a favorable benefit/risk profile of trastuzumab deruxtecan in patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), reported Sung-Bae Kim, MD, PhD, with University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.In the phase 3 randomized, multicenter, open-label clinical trial, study participants received either trastuzumab deruxtecan or physician's choice of trastuzumab plus capecitabine or lapatinib or capecitabine. The primary results of the trial were published last year in The Lancet.As previously reported by Medscape Medical News, after median follow-up of 21.5 months in the trastuzumab deruxtecan group and 18.6 months in the treatment of choice group, median progression-free survival was 17.8 months for trastuzumab deruxtecan vs 6.9 months for the physician's choice group (HR, 0.36; P < .000001).The latest data show that after a median follow-up of 30.2 months in the trastuzumab deruxtecan group and 20.5 months in the treatment of choice group, median progression-free survival was 16.7 months with trastuzumab deruxtecan vs 5.5 months with the treatment of choice — a 70% reduction in risk for progression (HR, 0.30), Kim said.From time of randomization to progression to next line of therapy or death, median progression-free survival was 33.0 months with trastuzumab deruxtecan vs 15.0 with treatment of choice (HR, 0.42).Median overall survival was 35.7 months with trastuzumab deruxtecan vs 25.0 months with the treatment of choice, with the risk for death reduced by 31% with trastuzumab deruxtecan (HR, 0.69).The safety profile of trastuzumab deruxtecan continues to be ""manageable, with no long-term toxicity observed with longer follow-up,"" Kim told attendees. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were nausea (73%), fatigue (62%), and vomiting (38%).There were a total of 46 (11.4%) adjudicated drug-related interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis cases with trastuzumab deruxtecan. Most were grade 1 or 2. This risk did not increase with longer treatment duration; most events occurred within 12 months of starting treatment, Kim noted.With longer follow-up, results of DESTINY-Breast02 ""reinforce the substantial benefit"" of trastuzumab deruxtecan over the treatment of physician's choice in patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer previously treated with T-DM1, he concluded.Pooled Data from TROPiCS-02 and EVER-132-002Hope Rugo, MD, with the University of California San Francisco, and colleagues reported a meta-analysis of data from the phase 3 TROPiCS-02 and EVER-132-002 trials of the TROP2-directed ADC sacituzumab govitecan vs the treatment of physician's choice in HR+/HER2− metastatic breast cancer.In the pooled analysis, median overall survival was significantly longer with sacituzumab govitecan than with the treatment of physician's choice in the overall population (16.2 vs 12.7 months) and in patients who received prior CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment (15.4 vs 11.5 months). Progression-free survival also favored sacituzumab govitecan.These results are consistent with trial-level results from TROPICS-02 and EVER-132-002, reinforcing the efficacy benefits of sacituzumab govitecan over the treatment of physician's choice, the study team said.Evolving Landscape of ADCs in Breast CancerGiuseppe Curigliano, MD, PhD, with the University of Milan, Milan, Italy, who served as discussant for the TROPION-Breast01 safety analysis, noted that the clinical landscape of ADCs has ""evolved over time.""He added that despite having a similar target and similar payload, the anti-TROP2 ADCs in development for HR+/HER2− metastatic breast cancer — Dato-DXd, sacituzumab govitecan, and sacituzumab tirumotecan — appear to have different spectrums of toxicity.Looking ahead, he said it will be important to determine whether toxicity of these agents can be predicted with a pharmacogenomic analysis and whether toxicity is related to the payload or to the linker antibody complex.""The science and chemistry of ADCs has shown significant promise in terms of clinical activity, but we also need to better understand safety,"" Curigliano told attendees.""We need to pay attention to signals in the early phase trials of ADCs and be willing to adjust accordingly to maximize therapeutic benefit and minimize toxicity. Team science will be important in the future developmental ADCs,"" he added.TROPION-Breast01 was sponsored by AstraZeneca. DESTINY-Breast-02 was sponsored by Daiichi Sankyo. TROPiCS-02 and EVER-132-002 were supported by Gilead Sciences.

6,MedScape_123_Q2_2024,Media,How Medicare Reimbursement Trends May Affect Breast Surgeries,"How Medicare Reimbursement Trends May Affect Breast Surgeries Medicare reimbursement for common breast cancer surgeries decreased significantly over the past two decades, and the resulting shortage of funds could affect quality of care and access to services, especially for vulnerable patient populations.These were findings of new research presented by Terry P. Gao, MD, at the American Society of Breast Surgeons annual meeting.Medicare reimbursements often set a benchmark that is followed by private insurers, and the impact of changes on various breast surgeries have not been examined, Dr Gao, a research resident at Temple University Hospital, Philadelphia, said during a press briefing in advance of the meeting.""This study is important because it is the first to analyze trends in Medicare reimbursement for breast cancer surgery over a long period,"" Dr Gao said during an interview. The findings highlight a critical issue that could impact access to quality care, especially for vulnerable populations, she said.How Were the Data Analyzed?Dr Gao and colleagues reviewed percent changes in reimbursement procedures over a 20-year period and compared them to changes in the consumer price index (CPI) to show the real-life impact of inflation.The study examined reimbursements based on the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Look-Up Tool from 2003 to 2023 for 10 procedures. The procedures were core needle biopsy, open incisional breast biopsy, open excisional breast biopsy, lumpectomy, lumpectomy with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), simple mastectomy, radical mastectomy, modified radical mastectomy, biopsy/removal of lymph nodes, and sentinel lymph node biopsy.What Does the New Study Show?""Reimbursements did not keep pace with the price of goods and services,"" Dr Gao said during the press briefing.After the researchers corrected data for inflation, the overall mean Medicare reimbursement for breast cancer surgeries decreased by approximately 21%, based in part on the 69% increase in the CPI over the study period, Dr Gao said. The greatest change was in core needle biopsy, for which reimbursement decreased by 36%.After inflation adjustment, reimbursement increases were seen for only two procedures, lumpectomy and simple mastectomy, of 0.37% and 3.58%, respectively, but these do not represent meaningful gains, Dr Gao said.The researchers also used a model to estimate the real-life impact of decreased reimbursement on clinicians. They subtracted the actual 2023 compensation from expected 2023 compensation based on inflation for a breast cancer case incidence of 297,790 patients who underwent axillary surgery, breast lumpectomy, or simple mastectomy. The calculated potential real-world compensation loss for that year was $107,604,444.What Are the Clinical Implications?The current study is the first to put specific numbers on the trend in declining breast cancer payments, and the findings should encourage physicians to advocate for equitable policies, Dr Gao noted during the briefing.The substantial decrease in inflation-adjusted reimbursement rates was significant, she said during the interview. Although the decrease reflects similar trends seen in other specialties, the magnitude is a potential cause for concern, she said.Declining reimbursements could disproportionately hurt safety-net hospitals serving vulnerable populations by limiting their ability to invest in better care and potentially worsening existing racial disparities, Dr Gao told this publication. ""Additionally, surgeons may opt out of Medicare networks due to low rates, leading to access issues and longer wait times. Finally, these trends could discourage future generations from specializing in breast cancer surgery.""The study findings should be considered in the context of the complex and rapidly changing clinical landscape in which breast cancer care is evolving, Mediget Teshome, MD, chief of breast surgery at UCLA Health, said during an interview.""Surgery remains a critically important aspect to curative treatment,"" Dr Teshome said.Surgical decision-making tailored to each patient's goals involves coordination from a multidisciplinary team as well as skill and attention from surgeons, she added.""This degree of specialization and nuance is not always captured in reimbursement models for breast surgery,"" Dr Teshome emphasized. The policy implications of any changes in Medicare reimbursement will be important given the American Cancer Society reports breast cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women in the United States and as the second leading cause of cancer death in US women, she noted.What Additional Research Is Needed?Research is needed to understand how declining reimbursements affect patients' access to care, treatment choices, and long-term outcomes, Dr Gao said in the interview. Future studies also are needed to examine provider overhead costs, staffing structures, and profit margins to offer a more comprehensive understanding of financial sustainability.Dr Gao and Dr Teshome had no financial conflicts to disclose.This article originally appeared on MDedge.com, part of the Medscape Professional Network.","How Medicare Reimbursement Trends May Affect Breast Surgeries Medicare reimbursement for common breast cancer surgeries decreased significantly over the past two decades, and the resulting shortage of funds could affect quality of care and access to services, especially for vulnerable patient populations.These were findings of new research presented by Terry P.

Harold Burstein, from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Massachusetts, presents an analysis of the landmark RxPONDER trial, which found that levels of anti-Müllerian hormone may predict chemotherapy benefit in premenopausal women with receptor–positive breast cancer. The question of how to manage estrogen receptor–low tumors is the focus of the next study, which leveraged a large database to show that endocrine therapy does indeed offer a survival advantage. Two studies in triple-negative breast cancer are Dr Burstein's next choices, the first of which confirmed previous results suggesting that reduces the risk for recurrence. The second, the A-BRAVE study, indicated that adjuvant may confer an overall, but not disease-free, survival benefit. Finally, Dr Burstein highlights a study that examined the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists in breast cancer survivors. Although GLP-1 agonists are effective overall, weight loss with the drugs was tempered by endocrine therapy.","Key Takeaways in Early Breast Cancer From ASCO 2024 Identifying premenopausal responders to chemotherapy, the role of endocrine therapy in low receptor-expressing tumors, and improving survival in triple-negative disease are key takeaways in early presented at the 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting.

These findings were presented during the 2024 ASCO Annual Meeting.1“This is the first data to suggest [intracranial] antitumor activity with Dato-DXd in patients with heavily pretreated [advanced/metastatic] NSCLC,” the investigators wrote in their poster presentation of the data.Overall Response to Dato-DXdIn the post hoc analysis, at the data cutoff of December 14, 2022, 53 patients with baseline brain metastases demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 28% (95% CI, 17%-42%), including no complete responses (CRs), 28% with partial responses (PRs), 40% with stable disease (SD), and 19% with progressive disease (PD). In the group of 84 patients without baseline brain metastases, ORR was 40% (95% CI, 30%-52%), including 5% with CRs, 36% with PRs, 42% with SD, and 11% with PD.In addition, the disease control rate (DCR) for those with baseline brain metastases was 72% (95% CI, 58%-83%) and 83% (95% CI, 74%-91%) for those without. Similarly, clinical benefit rates (CBR) were 40% (95% CI, 27%-54%) and 51% (95% CI, 40%-62%), respectively.Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.4 months (95% CI, 3.1-7.0) for patients with baseline brain metastases and 5.6 months (95% CI, 4.9-8.3) for those without.Intracranial EfficacyWhen evaluating intracranial efficacy, the ORR for the 18 evaluable patients with baseline brain metastases was 22% (95% CI, 6%-48%), including 18% (95% CI, 2%-52%) for the EGFR-mutated subgroup (n = 11), 29% (95% CI, 4%-71%) for the non-EGFR-mutated subgroup (n = 7), and 20% (95% CI, 1%-72%) for the ALK rearrangement subgroup (n = 5).Of note, among the 3 patients with brain metastasis target lesions who did not undergo previous local therapy, 1 patient experienced central nervous system response (ORR, 33%).Among these 18 patients, DCR was 72% (95% CI, 47%-90%) and CBR was 44% (95% CI, 22%-69%). Lastly, intracranial PFS was 6.9 months (95% CI, 4.0-9.5).Dato-DXd SafetyAny-grade treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 91% of patients with brain metastases at baseline, compared with 96% of those without, with grade 3 or higher TRAEs occurring in 23% and 32% of patients in the respective groups.In patients with and without brain metastases at baseline, TRAEs led to dose reductions in 23% and 18%, respectively, dose delays in 17% and 24%, and treatment discontinuation in 4% and 6%. Serious TRAEs occurred in 8% of patients in both groups.TROPION-Lung05 TrialIn the phase 2, multicenter, single-arm, open-label TROPION-Lung05 trial, 137 patients received 6 mg/kg Dato-DXd every 3 weeks.Key eligibility criteria included stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV NSCLC; at least 1 actionable genomic alteration; ECOG performance status of 0 or 1; at least 1 line of targeted therapy; 1 or 2 prior cytotoxic agent-containing therapies including platinum-based therapy in the advanced/metastatic setting; and radiographic disease progression after the most recent therapy.ORR by blind independent committee review (BICR) served as the primary end point. Secondary end points included duration of response, DCR, CBR, PFS, and time to response by BICR and investigator assessment, as well as confirmed ORR by investigator assessment, overall survival, safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity.In this analysis, investigators focused on systemic efficacy and safety by central nervous system BICR baseline brain metastasis status and intracranial efficacy by mutation status.Among those with and without brain metastases at baseline, median age was 58 years (range, 36-75) and 63 years (range, 29-79), respectively. The majority were women (53% vs 65%, respectively), Asian (55% vs 58%), had an ECOG performance score of 1 (64% vs 69%), and were never smokers (55% vs 56%).Further, of those with and without baseline brain metastases, most had an EGFR mutation (55% vs 58%) or ALK rearrangement (28% vs 23%). In total, 72% of those with brain metastases at baseline had prior local therapy for their brain metastases, including radiation (59%), surgery (6%), and radiosurgery (23%).Further InvestigationThe median duration of treatment for those with baseline brain metastases was 3.2 months (range, 0.7-17.2) and 4.9 months (range, 0.7-20.6) for those without.At data cutoff, 15% of patients with baseline brain metastases and 14% of patients without remained on study treatment. Disease progression (70% and 75%, respectively) was the most common reason for discontinued treatment.“The data support further investigation of Dato-DXd in patients with brain [metastases],” the investigators concluded, adding that additional studies of the intracranial activity of the agent are ongoing, including the phase 2 TUXEDO-2 trial (NCT05866432) and the phase 2 DATO-BASE trial (NCT06176261).","Dato-DXd Demonstrates Intracranial Activity in Advanced NSCLC With/Without Brain Metastases Aaron Lisberg, MDAccording to findings from a post-hoc analysis of the phase 2 TROPION-Lung05 trial (NCT04484142), intracranial antitumor activity was observed with datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) in previously treated patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), including those with brain metastases at baseline.

9,Onclive_59_Q2_2024,Media,Updated CheckMate 816 Data Reinforce Neoadjuvant Nivolumab/Chemo as a SOC for Resectable NSCLC,"Updated CheckMate 816 Data Reinforce Neoadjuvant Nivolumab/Chemo as a SOC for Resectable NSCLC Jonathan Spicer, MD, PhDNeoadjuvant nivolumab (Opdivo) paired with chemotherapy showcased durable event-free survival (EFS) benefit and a trend toward improved overall survival (OS) vs chemotherapy alone in patients with resectable non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), according to data from the 4-year update of the phase 3 CheckMate 816 study (NCT02998528).1The findings, which were presented during the 2024 ASCO Annual Meeting, showed that the median EFS with nivolumab plus chemotherapy (n = 179) was 43.8 months (95% CI, 30.6-not reached [NR]) vs 18.4 months (95% CI, 14.0-26.7) with chemotherapy alone (n = 179), with a hazard ratio of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.49-0.90). The 48-month respective Kaplan Meier–estimated EFS rates were 49% (95% CI, 41%-57%) and 38% (95% CI, 30%-46%), respectively.The median OS was NR in both arms with a hazard ratio of 0.71 (98.36% CI, 0.47-1.07; unstratified HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.49-0.97). The significance boundary for OS, which was a P value of .0164, has not been met yet (P = .0451). The respective Kaplan Meier–estimated 48-month OS rates were 71% (95% CI, 63%-77%) and 58% (95% CI, 50%-65%). The median lung cancer–specific survival was also NR in both arms (unstratified HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.41-0.93), with respective Kaplan Meier–estimated 48-month rates of 79% (95% CI, 72%-84%) and 66% (95% CI, 58%-72%).“The 4-year updated [showed] that nivolumab plus chemotherapy had durable benefit despite the short course of treatment. This is statistically significant, as we have previously reported for EFS, and I would argue, clinically important, in terms of OS as opposed to chemotherapy [alone], with improved lung cancer–specific survival,” lead study author Jonathan D. Spicer, MD, PhD, assistant professor of surgery at McGill University Health Centre, in Quebec, Canada, said in a presentation of the data. “These improvements are occurring regardless of the type of platinum backbone utilized or the extent of surgical resection, sort of pointing to the fact that the surgeons need to extirpate all the disease by all means necessary in well-selected patients.”The international, open-label, phase 3 CheckMate 816 study enrolled adults with resectable stage IB to IIIA NSCLC who had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 and had not previously received anticancer therapy.2 To enroll, patients were required to have measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria. Those whose tumors harbored known ALK translocations or EGFR mutations were excluded.Study participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 360 mg of nivolumab plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy or platinum-doublet chemotherapy alone every 3 weeks for 3 cycles prior to undergoing definitive surgery. A third group of patients was given 3 mg/kg of nivolumab every 2 weeks for 3 cycles plus 1 mg/kg of ipilimumab (Yervoy) for cycle 1 only; this cohort closed enrollment early. Surgery was planned to happen within 6 weeks of the completion of the neoadjuvant treatment. After the procedure, patients in both groups were permitted to receive up to 4 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both.The primary end points of the study were EFS by blinded independent central review and pathologic complete response (pCR). Secondary end points comprised major pathologic response, time to death or distant metastases. Safety was assessed in all patients.Prior data from the prespecified interim analysis 1 of EFS and OS published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which had a median follow-up of 29.5 months, showed that the median EFS with nivolumab plus chemotherapy was 31.6 months (95% CI, 95% CI, 30.2-NR) vs 20.8 months (95% CI, 14.0-26.7) with chemotherapy alone (HR, 0.63; 97.38% CI, 0.43-0.91; P = .005). The respective pCRs were 24.0% (95% CI, 18.0%-31.0%) and 2.2% (95% CI, 0.6%-5.6%; OR, 13.94; 99% CI, 3.49%-55.75%; P < .001).Three-year data from the trial shared during the 2023 European Lung Cancer Congress showed that at a median follow-up of 41.4 months, the median EFS with nivolumab plus chemotherapy was NR (95% CI, 31.6-NR) vs 21.1 months (95% CI, 14.8-42.1) with chemotherapy alone (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.93).3 The median time between date of randomization and first date of distant metastases or date of death in the absence of distant metastases per BICR was NR (95% CI, 48.6-NR) in the nivolumab arm vs 34.3 months (95% CI, 23.6-NR) in the chemotherapy-alone arm (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.39-0.78). OS data remained immature at the time of the analysis (HR, 0.62; 99.34% CI, 0.36-1.05).At the 2024 ASCO Annual Meeting, Spicer shared findings from the 4-year update.1Spicer highlighted that, in concurrently randomized patients, the use of nivolumab plus chemotherapy was associated with a reduction in the need for any subsequent therapy vs chemotherapy alone (29% vs 50%), a reduction in the use of radiotherapy at any subsequent point for recurrent disease (13% vs 24%), and a reduction in the need for immunotherapy (10% vs 27%).OS “is not yet statistically significant” as “the boundary of 0.0164 was not crossed, but we have a sustained improvement of approximately 13% in OS [rate] at 48 months,” Spicer said. “Just perhaps for reference for those of you who might not know, ADAURA [NCT02511106] had a 10% OS benefit, and here, we’re seeing a 13% increment, and I think that’s clinically important.”He added, “With regard to lung cancer–specific survival, the median is, of course, NR, but we have corroborating evidence of improvements in disease control that is specific to lung cancer, with a 13% improvement at 40 months.” Moreover, those in the nivolumab/chemotherapy arm who had a pCR continued to have improved OS vs those who did not (HR, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.02-0.34), with respective 48-month OS rates of 95% and 63%.Investigators also examined OS by the neoadjuvant platinum chemotherapy received. In those who received cisplatin who were in the nivolumab/chemotherapy arm (n = 124), the median OS was NR; those in the chemotherapy arm (n = 134) who received cisplatin also had a median OS that was NR (95% CI, 50.4-NR) with a hazard ratio of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.53-1.17). The respective 48-month OS rates were 69% (95% CI, 60%-76%) and 60% (95% CI, 51%-68%). In those given carboplatin, the median OS was NR in the nivolumab/chemotherapy arm (n = 39) vs 37.2 months (95% CI, 16.8-NR) in the chemotherapy-alone arm (n = 33), with a hazard ratio of 0.36 (95% CI, 0.16-0.81). The respective 48-month OS rates were 80% (95% CI, 63%-89%) and 50% (95% CI, 32%-66%).“We see compelling data for carboplatin. Of course, this was perhaps enriched for squamous histology as this was the regimen that could be employed without having to reach out to medical monitor,” Spicer noted. “Otherwise, patients had to have comorbidities to justify the use of carboplatin. But an 80% OS [rate] at 48 months, it seems to be a perfectly reasonable regimen to employ.”Spicer and colleagues also evaluated OS by extent of resection. In the lobectomy cohort, those who received nivolumab plus chemotherapy (n = 115) experienced a median OS that was NR vs NR in those given chemotherapy alone (n = 82), with a hazard ratio of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.41-1.21). The respective 48-month OS rates were 79% (95% CI, 70%-86%) and 69% (95% CI, 58%-78%). In the pneumonectomy cohort, those who received nivolumab/chemotherapy (n = 25) experienced a median OS that was NR vs 61.8 months (95% CI, 31.2-NR) with chemotherapy alone (n = 34), with a hazard ratio that was not calculable. The respective 48-month OS rates were 80% (95% CI, 58%-91%) and 56% (95% CI, 37%-70%).“These data from a surgical perspective are quite important and provocative,” Spicer said. “We see the benefit with the lobectomy cohort, but the pneumonectomy cohort has [OS rates of] 80% vs 56%. If you think back to what we know of the trial [led by Dr Kathy Albain and colleagues], where there was a clear toxicity for the application of pneumonectomy after chemoradiation, here, we’re seeing a scenario where in well-selected patients, we can offer really excellent survival metrics for [certain] patients.” In concurrently randomized patients, 25% (n = 89) had evaluable circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels and 24% (n = 86) had detectable ctDNA levels at baseline. The percentage of patients in the nivolumab/chemotherapy arm who achieved ctDNA clearance was 56% vs 35% of those in the chemotherapy-alone arm. The hazard ratio for ctDNA clearance vs no ctDNA clearance with nivolumab plus chemotherapy was 0.31 (95% CI, 0.10-0.90); with chemotherapy alone, the HR was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.20-1.64).“We have a 56% ctDNA clearance rate in the patients who are biomarker evaluable [in the nivolumab group] vs 35% in the chemotherapy group,” Spicer said. “If you look at the Kaplan-Meier curves for OS by ctDNA clearance, they are somewhat reminiscent of what you might see for the pCR vs non-pCR patients. Clearly, ctDNA clearance is a very strong prognostic factor for predicting OS.”The safety profile of neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy was consistent with what has previously been reported with the regimen.In the nivolumab/chemotherapy arm (n = 176), any-grade adverse effects (AEs) occurred in 94% of patients, with 43% of events being grade 3 or 4. Any-grade serious AEs occurred in 17% of patients, with 11% of effects grade 3 or 4 in severity.Any-grade surgery-related AEs were reported in 45% of patients; 11% of these effects were grade 3 or 4. Grade 5 surgery-related AEs occurred in 2 patients on the nivolumab/chemotherapy arm, but both were not related to study treatment (pulmonary embolism, n = 1; aortic rupture, n = 1). All-grade treatment-related AEs led to discontinuation for 11% of patients who received the combination, and no treatment-related deaths were observed.“These 4-year results from CheckMate 816 provide the first understanding of the long-term benefits of neoadjuvant immunotherapy and chemotherapy and reinforce nivolumab plus chemotherapy as a standard of care for patients with resectable NSCLC,” Spicer concluded.","Updated CheckMate 816 Data Reinforce Neoadjuvant Nivolumab/Chemo as a SOC for Resectable NSCLC Jonathan Spicer, MD, PhDNeoadjuvant nivolumab (Opdivo) paired with chemotherapy showcased durable event-free survival (EFS) benefit and a trend toward improved overall survival (OS) vs chemotherapy alone in patients with resectable non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), according to data from the 4-year update of the phase 3 CheckMate 816 study (NCT02998528).1The findings, which were presented during the ...","['Jonathan Spicer, MD, PhDNeoadjuvant nivolumab ( Opdivo ) paired with chemotherapy showcased durable event - free survival ( EFS ) benefit and a trend toward improved overall survival ( OS ) vs chemotherapy alone in patients with resectable']","['), according to data from the 4 - year update of the phase 3 CheckMate 816 study ( NCT02998528 ). 1The findings, which were presented during the', '(', 'Updated CheckMate 816 Data Reinforce Neoadjuvant Nivolumab / Chemo as a SOC for Resectable', 'non – small cell lung cancer', 'NSCLC']",[],Overall Survival (OS),0.7901734709739685,"{'Overall Survival (OS)': 0.7901734709739685, 'General Opinion': 0.05374081805348396, 'Others': 0.03976016864180565, 'Safety-Side Effects': 0.039628900587558746, 'Safety-General': 0.029042325913906097, 'Progression Free Survival (PFS)': 0.02688479982316494, 'Efficacy-General': 0.020769430324435234}",neutral,0.7245482802391052,,,,,,,neutral,0.7245482802391052,,,,,rocky07,2025-09-03 20:52:18,BioBERT+BART+RoBERTa (GPU-accelerated),mps

Hope S. Rugo, MDThe addition of capivasertib (Truqap) to fulvestrant (Faslodex) led to an improvement in time to second progression (PFS2) compared with fulvestrant alone in patients with hormone receptor–positive, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, including in patients harboring at least 1 PIK3CA, AKT1, or PTEN alteration, according to data from the phase 3 CAPItello-291 trial (NCT04305496) presented during the 2024 ESMO Breast Cancer Congress.1Findings showed that in the overall population, patients treated with capivasertib plus fulvestrant (n = 355) experienced a median PFS2 of 14.7 months (95% CI, 13.6-16.4) compared with 12.5 months (95% CI, 11.3-13.4) for those given placebo plus fulvestrant (n = 353; adjusted HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.57-0.86).In the PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered population, the median PFS2 was 15.5 months (95% CI, 13.2-17.6) in the capivasertib arm (n = 155) compared with 10.8 months (95% CI, 8.1-12.7) for the placebo arm (n = 134; adjusted HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.38-0.71).Furthermore, capivasertib plus fulvestrant delayed time to first subsequent chemotherapy (TFSC) in the overall and PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered populations. In the overall population, the median TFSC was 11.0 months (95% CI, 9.4-13.0) for the capivasertib plus fulvestrant arm compared with 6.8 months (95% CI, 5.7-8.0) for the placebo plus fulvestrant arm (adjusted HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.52-0.75). In the PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered populations, the median TFSC was 11.0 months (95% CI, 9.1-13.6) in the capivasertib group compared with 6.0 months (95% CI, 4.4-8.0) in the placebo group (adjusted HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.42-0.74).“[These]data demonstrates that capivasertib with fulvestrant provided long-lasting benefits retained through PFS2 in patients with hormone receptor–positive, HER2-negative advanced disease who progressed on or after an endocrine-based regimen,” Hope S.

In the overall population, patients in the capivasertib arm achieved a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 7.2 months (95% CI, 5.5-7.4) compared with 3.6 months (95% CI, 2.8-3.7) for patients receiving placebo plus fulvestrant (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.51-0.71; P <.001). In patients harboring alterations in the AKT pathway, the median PFS was 7.3 months (95% CI, 5.5-9.0) for the capivasertib regimen vs 3.1 months (95% CI, 2.0-3.7) for the placebo regimen (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.38-0.65; P <.001).3The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled CAPItello-291 trial enrolled men and pre- or post-menopausal women with locally advanced or metastatic, hormone receptor–positive, HER2-negative breast cancer who experienced recurrence or progression during or within 12 months of completing adjuvant treatment with an aromatase inhibitor (AI), or during prior AI therapy for advanced breast cancer. Additionally, eligible patients must have undergone no more than 2 lines of prior endocrine therapy for advanced disease; no more than 1 line of chemotherapy; and no prior treatment with selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs), mTOR inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors, or AKT inhibitors. However, prior treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors was permitted. Notably, patients with HbA1c levels below 8.0% (63.9 mmol/mol) and diabetes not requiring insulin were eligible for enrollment.Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive capivasertib at 400 mg twice daily for 4 days on and 3 days off plus fulvestrant at 500 mg on days 1 and 15 during cycle 1, then once every 4 weeks thereafter; or placebo twice daily for 4 days on, 3 days off plus the same fulvestrant regimen. Stratification factors included liver metastases (yes vs no), treatment with a prior CDK4/6 inhibitor (yes vs no), and region.The dual primary end points of the study were PFS by investigator assessment in the overall population and in the PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered population. Key secondary end points included overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), and PFS2 in both patient populations. TFSC was an exploratory end point.In the overall population for the capivasertib plus fulvestrant arm, the median age of patients was 59 years (range, 26-84), and 80.8% were post-menopausal. Metastatic sites included bone only (14.4%) and visceral (66.8%). Primary endocrine resistance was reported at baseline in 35.8% of patients. The number of prior endocrine therapy regimens for advanced breast cancer included 0 lines (11.0%), 1 line (80.8%), and 2 lines (8.2%). Previous CDK4/6 inhibitor use was noted in 69.6% of patients, and 18.3% received previous chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer.In the placebo/fulvestrant group, the median age was 58 years (range, 26-90), and 73.7% were post-menopausal. Metastatic sites included bone only (14.7%) and visceral (68.3%). Primary endocrine resistance was reported in 38.2% of patients at baseline. Prior endocrine therapy for advanced breast cancer included 0 lines (15.3%), 1 line (71.4%), and 2 lines (13.3%). Additionally, 70.5% of patients received a prior CDK4/6 inhibitor, and previous chemotherapy for advanced disease was given to 18.1% of patients.Additional data showed that among patients in the overall population receiving capivasertib/fulvestrant, 70.1% of patients had disease progression, and 67.0% of patients went on to receive subsequent treatment. First subsequent treatment consisted of cytotoxic chemotherapy (43.1%), hormone therapy (22.3%), and targeted therapy (13.0%). In the placebo arm, 79.6% of patients had disease progression, and 74.8% went on to receive a first subsequent treatment, including cytotoxic chemotherapy (47.9%), hormone therapy (23.5%), or targeted therapy (18.1%).Among patients in the PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered population treated with capivasertib/fulvestrant, 74.2% of patients had disease progression, and 69.0% went on to receive a first subsequent treatment, including cytotoxic chemotherapy (43.2%), hormone therapy (23.9%), and targeted therapy (11.6%). In the placebo group, 80.6% of patients experienced disease progression, and 78.4% received a first subsequent therapy, including cytotoxic chemotherapy (50.0%), hormone therapy (25.4%), or targeted therapy (21.6%).Furthermore, in the overall population, treatments given in any subsequent line of therapy included cytotoxic chemotherapy (capivasertib/fulvestrant, 56.1%; placebo/fulvestrant, 61.2%), hormone therapy (27.6%; 30.3%), and targeted therapy (18.9%; 25.8%). In the PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered population, treatments given in any subsequent line of therapy, included cytotoxic chemotherapy (60.0%; 62.7%), hormone therapy (27.7%; 35.1%), and targeted therapy (16.8%; 32.1%).","Capivasertib/Fulvestrant Improves PFS2 in Pretreated PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN+ HR+/HER2– Breast Cancer Capivasertib plus fulvestrant improved time to second progression in patients with pretreated HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.

Kevin Kalinsky, MD, MSThe progression-free survival (PFS) benefit observed with abemaciclib (Verzenio) plus fulvestrant (Faslodex) vs placebo plus fulvestrant in patients with hormone receptor–positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer following disease progression on a CDK4/6 inhibitor and endocrine therapy highlighted to the potential for continuing a CDK4/6 inhibitor in this patient population, particularly in those who do not harbor ESR1 mutations or PI3K pathway alterations, according to Kevin Kalinsky, MD, MS.At the 2024 ASCO Annual Meeting, Kalinsky and colleagues shared data from the phase 3 postMONARCH study (NCT05169567), which demonstrated that the primary end point of investigator-assessed PFS was met at the time of the primary analysis. Treatment with the investigative combination (n = 182) elicited a median PFS of 6.0 months (95% CI, 5.6-8.6) compared with 5.3 months (95% CI, 3.7-5.6) with fulvestrant plus placebo (n = 186; HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57-0.95; P = .02).1“[Findings from postMONARCH] demonstrated that [continuing a a CDK4/6 inhibitor and switching endocrine therapy] is a strategy for patients [after frontline progression on a CDK4/6 inhibitor–based regimen]. Abemaciclib is widely available with a toxicity profile that we know and understand,” Kalinsky emphasized.In an interview with OncLive®, Kalinsky discussed the rationale for conducting this randomized phase 3 trial of fulvestrant plus placebo vs fulvestrant plus abemaciclib in patients with hormone receptor–positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer following disease progression on a CDK4/6 inhibitor and endocrine therapy; expanded on the results of the investigation; and highlighted outcomes in subgroups based on stratification factors and biomarker status.Kalinsky is a professor and medical oncology division director of the Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology at Emory University School of Medicine; director of the Glenn Family Breast Center at Emory Winship Cancer Institute; and a member of the Discovery and Developmental Therapeutics Research Program at Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia.OncLive: What was the rationale behind the postMONARCH trial?Kalinsky: We've had data from randomized phase 2 trials—[the MAINTAIN (NCT05207709), PALMIRA (NCT03809988), and PACE (NCT03147287) trials]—that have shown inconsistent findings in terms of whether there's a benefit for continuing a CDK4/6 inhibitor and switching the endocrine therapy after a patient has a tumor that has progressed on frontline hormonal therapy and an aromatase inhibitor. [postMONARCH] is the first randomized, phase 3 trial to address that question.How was the trial designed, and what were some of the key efficacy findings presented at the 2024 ASCO Annual Meeting?The trial design was for patients who had hormone receptor–positive, HER2-negative advanced disease. This was a true second-line study, where patients were patients were randomly assigned to fulvestrant plus placebo vs fulvestrant plus abemaciclib. This was a 1:1 [randomized] study that was looking at 368 patients were enrolled.The assumption was that we would see an investigator-assessed PFS difference with an HR of 0.70. That is what we saw. Our HR was 0.73, translating into a benefit for patients when they continued abemaciclib and switching endocrine therapy to fulvestrant after progression on frontline therapy.Were there safety findings from this analysis that are important to note?Safety was consistent with what we know about abemaciclib. We saw that 4% [of patients in the abemaciclib arm] had grade 3 or higher diarrhea, 25% had [grade 3 or higher] neutropenia, and 30% of patients dose reduced with, two-thirds of those being from 150 mg twice a day to 100 mg twice a day. Six percent of patients discontinued due to adverse effects.Were there any secondary end points or findings that are important to note?We did spend some time talking about the investigator-assessed PFS by the stratification factors. Those [factors] were visceral metastasis and prior duration on CDK4/6 inhibition. The majority of patients—[129 in the abemaciclib arm and 144 in the placebo arm]—were on their prior CDK4/6 inhibitor for at least 12 months. [In this population], there was an HR for PFS of 0.70 [95% CI, 0.52-0.94], and it translated into about a 1.6-month PFS difference [7.0 months (95% CI, 5.6-9.0) in the abemaciclib arm vs 5.4 months (95% CI, 4.0-5.7) in the placebo arm].When we look at those with or without visceral metastasis, in those without visceral metastasis, we had a HR for PFS of 0.53 [95% CI, 0.34-0.83], which translated into a 5.5-month median PFS benefit [11.1 months (95% CI, 6.3–not reached) in the abemaciclib arm vs 5.6 months (95% CI, 5.3-9.2) in the placebo arm]. In terms of visceral metastasis, the magnitude of benefit was a little bit lower [HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.64-1.17].What are the implications of these findings?Thirty percent of patients in this study were biomarker-negative, which means that they didn't have an ESR1 mutation or a PI3K pathway alteration. For those patients, this offers a targeted therapy option post–CDK4/6 inhibition.Additionally, regardless of whether you had the presence or absence of an ESR1 mutation or PI3K pathway alteration, we saw benefit with fulvestrant and abemaciclib.","postMONARCH Meets Primary End Point of Improvement of PFS in HR+/HER2– Breast Cancer Post–CDK4/6i Progression Kevin Kalinsky, MD, MS, discusses the outcomes of the postMONARCH study in patients with HR+/HER2– breast cancer following disease progression.

The median progression-free survival (PFS) with nivolumab was 7.9 months (95% CI, 7.6-9.5) vs 7.6 months (95% CI, 6.1-7.8) without (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.59-0.88; P = .0012).“In the CheckMate 901 trial, the combination of Opdivo with cisplatin and gemcitabine improved overall survival, reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 28% versus chemo alone, and demonstrated deep and durable responses versus chemo alone,” Michiel Van der Heijden, MD, PhD, medical oncologist and research group leader at Netherlands Cancer Institute, stated in a news release.1 “These findings are significant and reinforce that concurrent Opdivo and chemotherapy should be considered as a new standard of care for the first-line treatment of eligible patients with this difficult-to-treat cancer.”The phase 3 trial enrolled patients with treatment-naive unresectable or metastatic urothelial cancer involving the renal pelvis, ureter, bladder, or urethra.2 They needed to be at least 18 years of age, be eligible to receive cisplatin, and have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.Participants were randomized to receive gemcitabine at 1000 mg/m2 on day 1 and day 8 plus cisplatin at 70 mg/m2 on day 1 every 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles with or without nivolumab at 360 mg on day 1. Three weeks later, those who received the chemoimmunotherapy combination went on to receive nivolumab monotherapy at 480 mg every 4 weeks until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal, or up to 24 months. Stratification factors included PD-L1 expression (≥1% vs <1%) and liver metastases (yes vs no).OS and PFS by BICR served as the trial’s co-primary end points, and key secondary end points included OS and PFS in those with a PD-L1 expression of 1% or higher and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Important exploratory end points included objective response rate by BICR and safety.Final data from the study were reported during the 2023 ESMO Congress and had a median follow-up of 33.6 months (range, 7.4-62.4).The patient median age in the nivolumab/chemotherapy and chemotherapy-alone arms was 65 years (range, 32-86). The majority of patients were male (78% vs 77%) and White (69% vs 74%) and just under half (44% vs 47%) were from Europe. Fifty-three percent of patients in both arms had an ECOG performance status of 0. Most patients’ tumor type at initial diagnosis was urinary bladder (77% vs 72%). Regarding PD-L1 expression, more than half of patients in both arms had expression less than 1% or indeterminate (63% vs 64%) and the remainder had a status of 1% or higher (37% vs 36%). Liver metastases were present in 21% of patients in both arms.Additional efficacy data showed that the 12-month OS rates in the nivolumab/chemotherapy and chemotherapy-alone arms were 70.2% and 62.7%, respectively; the 24-month OS rates were 46.9% and 40.7%, respectively. Moreover, the respective 12-month PFS rates were 34.2% and 21.8% and the 24-month rates were 23.5% and 9.6%.For the primary analysis of PFS in the study, those who subsequently received anticancer therapy prior to disease progression were censored; this was 8% of those in the nivolumab arm and 24% of those in the chemotherapy-alone arm. In the chemotherapy-alone arm, immunotherapy represented the most commonly received subsequent treatment prior to progression. Investigators conducted a sensitivity analysis in which these patients were not censored. The median PFS in the nivolumab/chemotherapy arm was 7.9 months (95% CI, 7.6-9.5) vs 7.5 months (95% CI, 6.1-7.8) in the chemotherapy-alone arm (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.62-0.89).The ORR achieved with the nivolumab regimen was 57.6% (95% CI, 51.8%-63.2%), which included a complete response (CR) rate of 21.7% and a partial response (PR) rate of 35.9%. The ORR reported with chemotherapy-alone was 43.1% (95% CI, 37.5%-48.9%), which comprised CR and PR rates of 11.8% and 31.3%, respectively. The median time to response in both arms was 2.1 months. The median duration of response (DOR) with nivolumab plus chemotherapy was 9.5 months (95% CI, 7.6-15.1) vs 7.3 months (95% CI, 5.7-8.9) with chemotherapy alone. The 24-month DOR rates in these respective arms were 35.0% and 12.6%.HRQOL was maintained with the addition of nivolumab to chemotherapy.Treatment-related adverse effects (TRAEs) of any grade occurred in 97% of those in the nivolumab arm vs 93% of those in the chemotherapy-alone arm; these effects were grade 3 or higher for 62% and 52% of patients, respectively. In the nivolumab/chemotherapy arm, any-grade TRAEs resulted in discontinuation for 21% of patients; 11% of patients experienced grade 3 or higher TRAEs that led to discontinuation. In the chemotherapy-alone arm, any-grade and grade 3 or higher TRAEs resulted in discontinuation for 17% and 8% of patients, respectively.In the nivolumab/chemotherapy arm, the most common TRAEs included anemia (grade 1/2, 57%; grade ≥3, 22%), nausea (47%; <1%), neutropenia (31%; 19%), decreased neutrophil count (25%; 14%), fatigue (24%; 2%), decreased appetite (22%; 1%), decreased platelet count (22%; 8%), decreased white blood cell count (21%; 10%), vomiting (18%; 1%), asthenia (15%; 1%), thrombocytopenia (15%; 7%), pruritus (14%; 1%), constipation (14%; 0%), rash (13%; 1%), diarrhea (13%; 1%), hypothyroidism (13%; 0%), increased blood creatinine (13%; <1%), and leukopenia (13%; 2%).Previously, in March 2024, the FDA approved nivolumab plus cisplatin and gemcitabine for frontline use in patients with unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma based on CheckMate 901 data.3 In a recent interview with OncLive®, Matthew Galsky, MD, of The Tisch Cancer Institute of Mount Sinai, in New York, noted that this was the first phase 3 trial to elicit positive results with the addition of immunotherapy to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in this population.","Frontline Nivolumab/Chemo Approved in Europe for Unresectable or Metastatic Urothelial Cancer Michiel Van der Heijden, MD, PhDThe European Commission has approved nivolumab (Opdivo) paired with cisplatin and gemcitabine for the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma.1The regulatory decision was supported by findings from the phase 3 CheckMate 901 study (NCT03036098) in which nivolumab plus chemotherapy followed by single-agent nivolumab (n = 3...","['. 1The regulatory decision was supported by findings from the phase 3 CheckMate 901 study ( NCT03036098 ) in which nivolumab plus chemotherapy followed by single - agent nivolumab ( n = 3', 'Michiel Van der Heijden, MD, PhDThe European Commission has approved nivolumab ( Opdivo ) paired with cisplatin and gemcitabine for the first - line treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic']","['Frontline Nivolumab / Chemo Approved in Europe for Unresectable or Metastatic', 'Urothelial Cancer', 'urothelial carcinoma']",[],Safety-Side Effects,0.22835659980773926,"{'Safety-Side Effects': 0.22835659980773926, 'General Opinion': 0.22126562893390656, 'Others': 0.1408204734325409, 'Efficacy-General': 0.13177408277988434, 'Safety-General': 0.1287303864955902, 'Overall Survival (OS)': 0.0762447714805603, 'Progression Free Survival (PFS)': 0.07280806452035904}",neutral,0.8625845313072205,,,,,,,,,neutral,0.8625845313072205,,,rocky07,2025-09-03 20:52:18,BioBERT+BART+RoBERTa (GPU-accelerated),mps

Additionally, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 13 months (95% CI, 7-16) and the median overall survival (OS) was 28 months (95% CI, 23-43).“This extended follow-up analysis demonstrates promising efficacy, and highlights the potential for sustained responses with cabozantinib plus nivolumab in patients with metastatic non-clear cell RCC,” Kelly N. Fitzgerald, MD, a genitourinary oncologist at UCSF Health in San Francisco, California, and coauthors wrote.The single-center, investigator-initiated study enrolled patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic papillary, unclassified, or translocation-associated RCC. Patients could have received 1 prior line of systemic therapy and prior cabozantinib exposure was not allowed.Patients received oral cabozantinib 40 mg daily and intravenous nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks, with dose reduction and reescalation permitted. Study treatment continued until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or patient withdrawal. The primary end point was ORR by RECIST 1.1 criteria and secondary end points included OS, PFS, and safety.The median age of the study population was 57 years (IQR, 51-66). Most patients were male (70%), underwent a prior nephrectomy (67%), and had papillary histology (80%), a Karnofsky performance status of 90 (73%), and intermediate International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium risk disease (67%). Thirty-five percent of patients received prior systemic therapy including a VEGF inhibitor (25%), mTOR inhibitor (20%), and/or chemotherapy (5.0%). Further, patients had lymph node (78%), lung (45%), bone (30%), retroperitoneum/peritoneum (25%), and/or liver metastases (20%).Additional findings from the study showed that the median duration of response (DOR) was 17 months (95% CI, 10-20); the 12- and 24-month DOR rates were 63% (95% CI, 38%-80%) and 32% (95% CI, 13%-52%), respectively.

14,Onclive_860_Q2_2024,Media,Mainstreaming of Genetic Testing Is Tied to Increased Testing Rates in Ovarian Cancer ,"Mainstreaming of Genetic Testing Is Tied to Increased Testing Rates in Ovarian Cancer Ying Liu, MD, MPH, and Tiffany Sia, MD, discuss the benefits of mainstreaming genetic testing in patients with ovarian cancer. Ying Liu, MD, MPHSeamlessly integrating genetic testing into gynecologic oncology clinics may lead to increased genetic testing rates among patients with ovarian cancer, according to Ying Liu, MD, MPH. Additionally, mainstreaming efforts may widen the scope of genetic testing to reach patients who have certain disease characteristics or are part of certain demographics that make them less likely to receive this testing, Tiffany Sia, MD, added.At the 2024 SGO Annual Meeting on Women’s Cancer, Liu and Sia presented findings from a study that evaluated the effects of mainstreamed genetic testing among patients with newly diagnosed epithelial ovarian cancer who received care at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, New York. Findings showed that among 1742 patients, 91.3% underwent genetic germline testing vs 8.6% who did not undergo testing.“Doing the [genetic testing] process together [with gynecologic oncology care] and streamlining it takes mainstreaming to the next level,” Liu said in an interview with OncLive® during the 2024 SGO Annual Meeting.“We should still continue to enforce universal recommendations for germline genetic testing,” Sia added in the interview.Tiffany Sia, MDIn the interview, Liu and Sia discussed the far-reaching benefits of performing genetic testing in patients with ovarian cancer, how the findings from this research support the mainstreaming of genetic testing and questions that remain to be answered through future research.Liu is a gynecologic oncologist and clinical geneticist at Memorial Sloan Kettering, where she is also the leader of the Inherited Gynecologic Cancer Program.Sia is a gynecologic oncology fellow at Memorial Sloan Kettering.OncLive: What was the rationale for exploring the effect of mainstreaming genetic testing for patients with ovarian cancer?Liu: Genetic testing in ovarian cancer is so important. It's been a universal recommendation for over 10 years. However, unfortunately, studies have shown that not all women are getting tested; approximately only one-third of women [with ovarian cancer undergo testing]. We’re investigating novel ways to get more women tested. One [way] has been to implement genetic testing into the oncology clinic and do it simultaneously with the oncology work. That's what we looked at in our own clinics.What makes genetic testing so vital for patients with ovarian cancer?Liu: Genetic testing is so important in ovarian cancer because approximately 15% to 20% of women with ovarian cancer have [this disease] because of a genetic reason they were born with, which they can pass on to their children and that can affect their family members.[Genetic testing is] important for 2 reasons. One, it affects treatments, because certain targeted therapies, such as PARP inhibitors, are beneficial in women with mutations in genes such as BRCA1, BRCA2, and others. That's important to know for their treatment because these treatments have improved cure rates and overall survival outcomes [in patients harboring these mutations].The second reason [genetic testing] is so important is for cancer prevention [for patients’] family members. When women with ovarian cancer get genetic testing, this can lead to cascade testing for their family members and gives them an opportunity to prevent ovarian cancer through risk-reducing measures.What is the definition of ""mainstreaming,"" as outlined in this research?Sia: ‘Mainstreaming’ is defined as the integration of genetic testing directly into oncology clinics. Traditionally, after the oncologist met with the patient and determined if they were a candidate for genetic testing, they would make a referral to a genetics counselor, who would set up a separate appointment to meet with the patient, counsel them, run the test, and give them the results.Mainstreaming was implemented in January 2019 for patients with ovarian cancer [at Memorial Sloan Kettering]. With the implementation of mainstreaming, the oncologist would meet with the patient, counsel them about genetic testing, order the testing, and perform the testing themselves. The patient would leave a blood sample, and the oncologist would go over the result with the patient. In cases of a positive finding, the patient would be referred to a genetics counselor to discuss the implications [of this finding] and talk about cascade testing for other family members.Liu: The mainstreaming in our study and at Memorial Sloan Kettering is unique because we do it in an integrated fashion with tumor testing. We do it through something called MSK-IMPACT, where patients get simultaneous genetic or germline testing with their tumor testing.What were the key findings from this study?Sia: We wanted to determine how the implementation of mainstreaming affected the percentage of patients who underwent germline genetic testing within Memorial Sloan Kettering. Prior to mainstreaming, the average percentage of patients who underwent germline genetic testing was 87% [at Memorial Sloan Kettering from 2015 to 2018]. After the implementation of mainstreaming, that number jumped to 91.3%. The rate of patients who underwent testing per year increased over time.[We evaluated] patient factors, such as age; self-reported race and ethnicity; and type of primary treatment, such as primary debulking surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We also assessed social demographic factors, such as Yost score, which is a measure of a neighborhood’s socioeconomic status based upon the patient's zip code; marital status; education; insurance; and National Cancer Institute comorbidity index. On multivariable analyses, mainstreaming was significantly associated with increased odds of genetic testing, even after adjusting for [factors] such as receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, [disease] stage, and histology.What next steps are planned for this research?Liu: This research showed us that testing rates with our current method are high, but it found specific areas where we could improve our efforts. One of the ways we are working on improvements is a quality improvement project to try to make this process even more seamless and patient-directed.One of the [benefits to come from the COVID-19 pandemic] in the genetics field is that it led to a lot of telemedicine and telegenetics, and it gave patients the power to self-direct their genetic testing. That's one of the aspects we want to incorporate into this mainstreaming process to see if that will further improve genetic testing rates and specifically help with some of the disparities we found. Additionally, some of our multivariable models revealed that patients with nonserous disease histologies who are not married and [have] other clinical factors might be less likely to get genetic testing. These are areas we can focus on.What are the future implications of these findings?Sia: Our findings show that germline genetic testing should be recommended and performed in all patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, regardless of histology, age, or self-reported race or ethnicity. We highlighted the factors that are associated with decreased testing rates. Even though this [study was conducted] within Memorial Sloan Kettering, the findings can be applied throughout all of [the United States].What is your main message for colleagues regarding the importance of genetic testing in patients with ovarian cancer?Liu: Do the genetic testing [through whatever means necessary] to get it done. We need to achieve that 100% [testing rate]. Try to integrate [genetic testing] with tumor testing, because then you can get [findings from 2 tests at 1 time] and get more information for the patient.","Mainstreaming of Genetic Testing Is Tied to Increased Testing Rates in Ovarian Cancer Ying Liu, MD, MPH, and Tiffany Sia, MD, discuss the benefits of mainstreaming genetic testing in patients with ovarian cancer.

15,Onclive_1056_Q2_2024,Media,Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors Revolutionize Endometrial Cancer Treatment,"Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors Revolutionize Endometrial Cancer Treatment The incorporation of immune checkpoint inhibitors has altered the treatment paradigm for endometrial cancer. Monique A. Spillman, MD, PhDThe International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) system characterizes endometrial cancer by grade and stage. Surgery is the main treatment, with chemotherapy or radiation therapy based on stage, patient characteristics, and histology. Modern molecular analysis has further stratified endometrial carcinomas. Loss of mismatch repair (MMR) proteins (MLH1, MSH2, PMS1, or MSH6) results in high microsatellite instability (MSI-H), a hallmark of Lynch syndrome.1 MMR deficient (dMMR) tumors may express PD-L1, which is the cell surface activator of the PD-1 receptor protein. When PD-1 receptors on the surface of T cells bind the PD-L1 ligand on the tumor cell, the tumor cell turns off the killing function of the T cell. However, the killing action of the T-cell–specific response can be reactivated by blocking the PD-L1 protein, or by preventing tumor cell binding at the PD-1 receptor. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), such as pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and dostarlimab-gxly (Jemperli), include high affinity, high specificity, and humanized monoclonal antibodies to the PD-1 receptor, preventing inactivation of the T cells.Immunotherapy in Advanced-Stage Endometrial CancerAccording to research results published in several journals, approximately 48% of endometrial carcinomas display PD-L1 positivity, and approximately 25% to 31% are dMMR.2-4 In those tumors, the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab was initially studied in the multicohort phase 1 KEYNOTE-028 trial (NCT02054806).2 This study enrolled 24 patients with advanced-stage, progressive endometrial cancer. PD-L1 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry with 1% positivity in tumor and immune cells denoted as positive. The objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST v1.1 criteria was 13% (95% CI, 2.8%-33.6%) in response-evaluable patients (n = 23). Three patients had partial responses (PR), 3 had stable disease (SD), and 13 experienced progressive disease.2The phase 2 KEYNOTE-158 study (NCT02628067) investigated pembrolizumab in patients with dMMR or MSI-H advanced solid tumors, including endometrial cancer. Ninety patients with dMMR/MSI-H endometrial cancer were enrolled and received pembrolizumab monotherapy on a 3-week cycle for 35 cycles. Of these patients, 48% had received at least 2 prior lines of therapy, and 68% had received prior radiation. The efficacy analysis was conducted in 79 patients who had received at least 1 dose of pembrolizumab at least 26 weeks prior to data cutoff. An ORR of 48% (95% CI, 37%-60%) was observed, including 11 patients with complete responses, 27 with PRs, and 14 with SD.5 Treatment tolerance was fair, with grade 3 to 4 adverse effects (AEs) reported in 12% of patients in the safety population (n = 90).5Combining immunotherapy with chemotherapy was the next step. Results of 2 blockbuster trials were published simultaneously in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2023.6,7 In a phase 3 study (NCT03914612), investigators combined pembrolizumab with carboplatin and paclitaxel in all endometrial carcinoma histologies except carcinosarcomas. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 816 patients with stage III to IVB or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) and patients were stratified by dMMR or pMMR (MMR proficient) status.6A significant PFS advantage was observed in the patients with dMMR disease who received pembrolizumab (n = 112) vs placebo (n = 113); the 12-month PFS rates were 74% vs 38%, respectively. The PFS HR was 0.30 (95% CI 0.19-0.48, P < .001) in favor of pembrolizumab in the dMMR cohort. Interestingly, in the pMMR cohort, the median PFS also favored pembrolizumab at 13.1 months (95% CI, 10.5-18.8) vs 8.7 months (95% CI, 8.4-10.7) in the placebo arm (HR 0.54; 95% CI, 0.41- 0.71; P < .001).6In the phase 3 RUBY trial (NCT03981796), dostarlimab was combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel. The study enrolled patients with recurrent or primary advanced endometrial cancer; carcinosarcomas and other histologies were allowed, and OS was assessed in addition to PFS.7 RUBY was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of 494 patients; 23.9% had dMMR/MSI-H disease. In the dMMR/MSI-H cohort, PFS rate at 24 months favored the dostarlimab arm (n = 53) at 61.4% (95% CI, 46.3%-73.4%) vs 15.7% (95% CI, 7.2%-27.0%) in the placebo arm (n = 65; HR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.16-0.50; P < .001). When patients with pMMR and dMMR disease were both included, the 24-month PFS rate still favored the dostarlimab arm (n = 245) at 36.1% (95% CI, 29.3%-42.9%) vs 18.1% (95% CI, 13.0%-23.9%) in the placebo arm (n = 249; HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51-0.80; P < .001).7 OS rates assessed at 24 months mirrored the PFS rates, favoring dostarlimab at 71.3% (95% CI, 64.5%-77.1%) vs 56.0% (95% CI, 48.9%-62.5%) for placebo (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.46-0.87; P = .0021). Therapy with dostarlimab or placebo was given every 6 weeks for up to 3 years.7Based on findings from the RUBY trial, the FDA approved dostarlimab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel followed by single-agent dostarlimab in advanced or recurrent dMMR or MSI-H endometrial carcinomas.8 Pembrolizumab had previously received FDA approval in March 2022 for use in recurrent endometrial carcinomas that were dMMR/MSI-H.9Immunotherapy in Recurrent Endometrial CancerThe use of ICIs in pMMR/microsatellite stable (MSS) endometrial carcinomas has also been investigated in recurrent endometrial cancer. The VEGF angiogenesis pathway is an important target for the modulation of T-cell immune response through tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as lenvatinib (Lenvima). The combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab was superior to lenvatinib alone in preclinical models, leading to a phase 1b/2 KEYNOTE-146/Study 111 trial (NCT02501096) in advanced solid tumors.This trial included 23 patients with endometrial carcinoma, with 48% percent receiving previous systemic therapy in the metastatic setting. Fifty-two percent of the endometrial cancers were PD-L1 positive. Findings from the phase 2 expansion portion demonstrated that the ORR among all patients in the endometrial cancer cohort was 52% (95% CI, 30.6%-73.2%). The median PFS was 9.7 months (95% CI, 4.2-not estimable [NE]). This trial did not specifically test for dMMR or MSI-H status but inferred a potential use in pMMR/MSS tumors from a previous observation that only 25% to 35% of endometrial cancers are dMMR/MSI-H.10Subsequent findings from the final primary efficacy analysis of the endometrial cancer cohort (n = 108) were stratified by MSI-H/dMMR (n = 11) or MSS/pMMR (n = 94) status. At the median follow-up of 18.7 months (95% CI, 13.1-20.3), the ORR was 63.6% (95% CI, 30.8%-89.1%) in patients with MSI-H tumors and 36.2% (95% CI, 26.5%- 46.7%) in those with MSS tumors. The combined group median duration of response was 21.2 months (95% CI, 7.6-NE), the median PFS was 7.4 months (95% CI, 5.3-8.7), and the median OS was 16.7 months (95% CI, 15-NE). The combination had a 66.9% rate of grade 3 or 4 AEs but displayed a generally manageable toxicity profile.11In the phase 3 KEYNOTE-775 trial (NCT03517449), patients with platinum-resistant endometrial cancer were randomly assigned to receive pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib or chemotherapy (doxorubicin or weekly paclitaxel). The 827 patients included 697 with pMMR/MSS disease and 130 with dMMR/MSI-H disease, equally divided between 2 arms. Both PFS and OS favored the combination of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib in the overall trial population; the median PFS was 7.2 months (95% CI, 5.7-7.6) vs 3.8 months (95% CI, 3.6-4.2), respectively (HR 0.56; 95% CI, 0.47-0.66; P < .001) and the median OS was 18.3 months (95% CI, 15.2-20.5) vs 11.4 months (95% CI, 10.5-12.9), respectively (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.51-0.75; P < .001).12In the majority pMMR/MSS group, the results held with both PFS and OS favoring pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib over chemotherapy. pMMR PFS was 6.6 months (95% CI, 5.6-7.4) vs 3.8 months (95% CI, 3.6-5.0), respectively (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.50-0.72; P < .001) and pMMR OS was 17.4 months (95% CI, 14.2-19.9) vs 12.0 months (95% CI, 10.8-13.3), respectively (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.56-0.84; P < .001).12Based upon results of this trial, the FDA approved the combination of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib in patients with pMMR endometrial cancer with progressive disease who are not candidates for radiation or surgery.13","Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors Revolutionize Endometrial Cancer Treatment The incorporation of immune checkpoint inhibitors has altered the treatment paradigm for endometrial cancer.

Rita Nanda, MD, associate professor, medicine, director, Breast Oncology Program, University of Chicago, UChicago Medicine, discusses the future of neoadjuvant treatment for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, highlighting the importance of targeted therapies.Nanda discusses both previous and emerging data concerning the use of neoadjuvant therapy in HER2-positive breast cancer and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Neoadjuvant therapy has now become the gold standard for treating patients with stage II and III HER2-positive breast cancer and TNBC, she says. This is primarily because each patient's response to this treatment regimen provides crucial insights into subsequent adjuvant strategies, Nanda states, emphasizing the significance of neoadjuvant therapy data particularly in early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer and TNBC cases.Moving forward, decisions regarding adjuvant therapy are greatly influenced by the patient's response to neoadjuvant therapy, she expands. Patients exhibiting a favorable response typically continue with HER2-directed therapy involving trastuzumab (Herceptin) and pertuzumab (Perjeta) for HER2-positive breast cancer, or adjuvant pembrolizumab (Keytruda) for TNBC, Nanda relays. However, ongoing trials are exploring alternative treatment approaches for patients who do not achieve a pathological complete response (CR) to neoadjuvant therapy, aiming to refine risk-reduction strategies, she notes.Furthermore, there is growing interest in optimizing therapy for patients showing exceptional neoadjuvant therapy responses, Nanda continues. This includes potentially reducing the intensity of adjuvant pembrolizumab or tailoring therapy specifically for HER2-positive patients based on their response to taxane-based regimens, possibly reducing or eliminating anthracycline-based treatments, she says. Exciting developments in trials aim to enhance the management of high-risk, early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer and TNBC cases, Nanda adds. In advanced HER2-positive disease, the introduction of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (Enhertu) has produced notable outcomes, according to Nanda. Consequently, ongoing research is investigating the possibility of integrating this agent into neoadjuvant or adjuvant protocols for patients not achieving a CR to standard therapy, Nanda reports.As new therapies emerge, they may displace current treatment practices, Nanda says. The future direction of treatment modalities remains dynamic, and anticipation mounts as the breast cancer field awaits further advancements, Nanda concludes.","Dr Nanda on Neoadjuvant Treatment in HER2+ Breast Cancer Rita Nanda, MD, discusses the future of neoadjuvant treatment for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer.

18,TargetedOncology_2_Q2_2024,Media,"Unlocking Latest Insights Into HR-Positive, HER2-Negative Treatment Strategies","Unlocking Latest Insights Into HR-Positive, HER2-Negative Treatment Strategies Recent approvals herald novel strategies for addressing advanced or metastatic breast cancer with ESR1 mutations.CDK4/6 inhibitors mark a substantial stride in the treatment of hormone receptor (HR)–positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. However, the focus on optimizing outcomes centers on their combination with aromatase inhibitors. Recent approvals herald novel strategies for addressing advanced or metastatic breast cancer with ESR1 mutations. These pivotal updates were shared by William J. Gradishar, MD, during the National Comprehensive Cancer Network 2024 Annual Conference.1 “I’m going to touch on different issues in advanced disease regarding CDK4/6 inhibitors and the nuances of where we can use these drugs [before] and after disease progression. We’ll look at some new therapies that have become available and those we anticipate will be available [mentioned below] and how we incorporate mutational status in our decision-making,” Gradishar said. Gradishar is the Betsy Bramsen professor of breast oncology, professor of medicine, and chief in the Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University. He is also deputy director for the clinical network and director of the Maggie Daley Center for Women’s Cancer Care at the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center in Chicago, Illinois. There are 3 CDK4/6 inhibitors currently available for metastatic disease in the first- and second-line settings: abemaciclib (Verzenio), palbociclib (Ibrance), and ribociclib (Kisqali). “If you look at data across the PALOMA[-2] trial [NCT01740427], the MONALEESA trials [NCT01958021, NCT02278120, NCT02422615], and the MONARCH trials [NCT02246621, NCT02107703], there is a consistency in the results that is quite striking,” Gradishar began. These trial results were consistent across the board specifically regarding the progression-free survival rates (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR) in the f irst-line setting and again in the second-line setting, all improving overall outcomes. The ORR rates in the first line were primarily in the 50% range across agents and, for the second-line setting, in the 40% range for abemaciclib and ribociclib. The PFS rates in the first line were primarily in the 20% range (P = .0001). As a result, these drugs are used in the first-line setting and 2 agents have emerged as producing the most survival benefit, ribociclib and abemaciclib, Gradishar explained. Furthermore, patients do well for a longer duration and many of the therapies are impacting PFS. Gradishar explained that a CDK4/6 inhibitor is often combined with an aromatase inhibitor (AI). However, there has been some debate about whether patients on adjuvant endocrine therapy with an AI, who later experience disease progression within a short time frame, might benefit more from a different combination. Investigators in the phase 2 PARSIFAL trial (NCT02491983) evaluated this by assessing whether fulvestrant (Faslodex) or letrozole (Femara) was the optimal endocrine partner for palbociclib in patients with untreated, endocrine-sensitive HR-positive/ HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.2 There is “completely overlapping outcome with respect to PFS; it made no difference whatsoever,” Gradishar stated. Chemotherapy, when compared with palbociclib plus hormone therapy, was also addressed. As shown by the data from the PEARL study (NCT02028507), there was no difference reported in overall survival (OS): 31.1 months for chemotherapy vs 32.8 months for palbociclib plus hormone therapy.3 In the ESR1 wild-type population, the PFS was also overlapping and conveyed no difference with using the same regimens. The data are similar according to the phase 2 Young Pearl study (NCT02592746), suggesting “that you do not need to feel compelled to go forward with chemotherapy,” Gradishar said.1,4 A question that remains unresolved is whether sequential CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy is effective. The phase 2 MAINTAIN trial (NCT02632045) data showed some improvement with ribociclib followed by endocrine therapy (n = 4) vs placebo followed by endocrine therapy (n=119). The median PFS was 5.29 months in the treatment arm vs 2.76 months with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.39-0.95; P = .006).5 Included were patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer who progressed during endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitor. It showed that there was a “signal suggesting that there may be a subset of patients where the use of sequential CDK4/6 inhibitors may offer some modest benefit,” Gradishar said. “At the American Society of Clinical Oncology [ASCO] Annual Meeting 2024 we will hear results from the [phase 3] postMONARCH trial [NCT05169567], which is for patients who have progressed on a CDK4/6 inhibitor and are randomly assigned to fulvestrant plus or minus abemaciclib.… We’ll see what these results are, but the collective takeaway is that it is not routine to use sequential CDK4/6 inhibitors yet,” Gradishar said. Regarding targeting the PIK3CA, AKT, and mTOR pathway, Gradishar addressed the phase 3 SOLAR-1 trial (NCT02437318) data that showed there was no benefit adding alpelisib (Piqray) with wild-type PIK3CA; however, if the patient has a PIK3CA mutation, there was an additional benefit with adding alpelisib to endocrine therapy.6 The median PFS was approximately 2 months in wild-type populations, but for those with a PIK3CA mutation, it doubled from 5 to 11 months. In the phase 3 CAPItello-291 trial (NCT04305496), patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative disease were randomly assigned to receive capivasertib with fulvestrant or placebo with fulvestrant.7 The agent appeared to be only effective in patients with an altered pathway, Gradishar said. The median PFS for patients with AKT pathway–altered tumors receiving the experimental treatment was 7.3 months vs 3.1 months in those in the control arm of the study (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.38-0.65; P =.001). The OR was trending positively but not yet statistically significant, Gradishar explained. In those with a PIK3CA alteration, the median PFS was 5.6 months vs 2.1 months, respectively, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.51 (95% CI, 0.37-0.70). For patients with a PTEN alteration, the median PFS was 9.1 months (range, 5.5-11.1) vs 3.6 (range, 1.8-6.7), respectively (hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.21-0.88). In the phase 2/3 INAVO120 trial (NCT04191499), investigators evaluated a triplet combination that included inavolisib, palbociclib, and fulvestrant (n=161) vs placebo with palbociclib and fulvestrant (n=164).8 The patients included in the trial had PIK3CA- mutated, HR-positive, HER2- negative disease. The ORR for the experimental treatment arm was 58.4% vs 25.0% in the control arm and the clinical benefit rate was 75.2% vs 47.0%, respectively. The median PFS was significantly improved from 7.3 months to 15 months with a stratified hazard ratio of 0.43 (P = .0001). T his suggests that for a patient who harbors a PIK3CA mutation, there may be some benefit with triplet therapy at the onset, then sequential treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor and following with a PIK3CA inhibitor, Gradishar said. However, the median OS is not yet reached. The phase 3 EMERALD trial (NCT03778931), which included patients with estrogen receptor– positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, evaluated elacestrant (Orserdu) vs investigator’s choice of AI or fulvestrant and showed an incremental PFS improvement with elacestrant.9 The longer the patient was taking a prior CDK4/6, the longer the PFS is with elacestrant compared with standard of care, Gradishar said.1 “Where the field is headed is toward a grouping of oral SERDs [selective estrogen receptor degraders],” Gradishar said, briefly addressing agents currently in development in the early stage setting as well as the metastatic setting, which include camizestrant, giredestrant, and imlunestrant. “Many [of these agents] have shown activity in patients who harbor ESR mutations and are likely to be combined with other endocrine therapy. They are reflected in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines and ASCO guidelines detailing where we use these drugs and how we think about implementing and incorporating these drugs into treatment plans,” Gradishar concluded.","Unlocking Latest Insights Into HR-Positive, HER2-Negative Treatment Strategies Recent approvals herald novel strategies for addressing advanced or metastatic breast cancer with ESR1 mutations.CDK4/6 inhibitors mark a substantial stride in the treatment of hormone receptor (HR)–positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.

Updated findings from the phase 2b trial were presented at the 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting. Transcription: 0:09 | Zanidatamab is a bispecific anti-HER2-directed antibody which binds on 2 domains on HER2 called ICD2 and ICD4. So last year, we presented the phase 2B HERIZON-BTC-01 trial, which is a global trial in patients with biliary tract cancers. We presented our 80 patients who were HER2-positive, and the way we defined them was IHC3+ or IHC2+, and they were ISH-positive, in situ hybridization-positive. 0:41 | Eighty patients were on the trial, they got zanidatamab maybe once every 2 weeks [intravenously], and we followed them out. The primary end point was overall response rate. Then, we have secondary end points like progression-free survival, overall survival, toxicity, so we presented that last year. And this year, we are presenting the updated results, long-term follow-up of that trial. 1:04 | Last year, our confirmed overall response rate was 41.3% [and] we had a duration of response of about 12.9 months, that was a duration of response. We followed those patients out, and now, the median duration of follow-up is 21.9 months. And again, the confirmed overall response rate remained the same, which is good, 41.3%. For comparison, let's say FOLFOX, which is chemotherapy in the second-line setting for BTC, has a response rate of 5%. This was obviously very promising. 1:42 | What we have seen is that the confirmed overall response rate remained the same, but the duration response increased to 14.9 months, so that actually improved and we were kind of happy about that. The median overall survival that we could report the data out [for, and] that we did not have the data mature last year, is about 15.5 months, so promising for these patients. 2:03 | We also are presenting the updated safety analysis, in which there were no new safety signals. In the original trial, we saw some diarrhea, which was the main one that kind of stayed, but we did not see any updated safety parameters.","Long-Term HERIZON-BTC-01 Data Shows Zanidatamab’s Potential in HER2+ BTC Shubham Pant, MD, discusses background on zanidatamab and findings from the HERIZON-BTC-01 trial of the agent for HER2-positive biliary tract cancer treatment.Shubham Pant, MD, professor in the Department of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology with a joint appointment in the Department of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, discusses background on zanidatamab (ZW25) and fi...","['treatment.

Tyson, II, MD, MPH, a urologic oncologist at Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, Arizona, discusses the safety and efficacy findings from the BOND-003 trial (NCT04452591) of cretostimogene grenadenorepvec for the treatment of patients with high-risk Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-unresponsive non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) with carcinoma in situ (CIS), which were presented at the 2024 American Urological Association (AUA) Annual Meeting. The single-arm, open-label BOND-003 study was developed to assess and confirm the clinical activity of cretostimogene grenadenorepvec in this patient population. A total of 112 patients with high-risk BCG-unresponsive NMIBC were enrolled. Results from the phase 3 BOND-003 study demonstrated sustained, durable complete responses (CR) over 12 months with cretostimogene grenadenorepvec, a novel investigational oncolytic immunotherapy. Notably, the CR rate in this patient population was 75.2%. Looking at safety, no grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) or deaths were reported. Two patients (1.8%) had serious TRAEs (Grade 2). There was also no treatment-related discontinuation of cretostimogene seen. A total of 94.5% of patients completed all expected treatments, and TRAEs were observed in 70 patients (62.5%). As of the safety cutoff date of January 31, 2024, the most frequently observed TRAEs (≥10%) consisted of bladder spasm, pollakiuria, dysuria, micturition urgency, and hematuria. Transcription: 0:09 | In total, 112 patients enrolled in BOND-003, and the data presented here are up to a cutoff date of April 1, 2024. In terms of baseline characteristics, most patients were White, male, and Medicare age. Eighteen percent of patients did have concomitant papillary disease, and as expected, the cohort was heavily pretreated with the median number of prior BCG installations of 12, with several other patients also having received pembrolizumab [Keytruda]. 0:41 | In terms of the efficacy analysis, the complete response rate at any time point for all patients based upon central path review was 75.2%, with the confidence interval indicating a range of plausible CRs between 65% and 83%. The swimmers plot is shown here, and the key observation worth noting is that 54% of patients who did not respond to the initial induction course of cretostimogene responded to the second induction course of cretostimogene with several patients whose response was durable to beyond 12 months. This speaks to the oncolytic immunotherapeutic mechanism of action, whereby the immune system switches from innate to adaptive, as seen with the second induction course of BCG. 1:30 | Secondly, of the 35 patients who hit the 12-month time point, 29 or 83% have maintained a duration of response of greater than 12 months with 22 complete responders still pending. Lastly, 92% of patients had not required a cystectomy at the 1-year time point. 1:52 | In terms of tolerability, cretostimogene has generally been well-tolerated. There were no great 3 treatment-related adverse events and no deaths. There were 2 grade 2 serious adverse events, and 1 patient did discontinue the trial, but this was due to an unrelated adverse event. Ninety-four and a half percent of patients completed all expected treatments.","Key Findings From BOND-003: Cretostimogene Grenadenorepvec in NMIBC Mark D.

Patients treated with osimertinib (n = 143) experienced a median PFS of 39.1 months (95% CI, 31.5–not calculable) vs 5.6 months (95% CI, 3.7-7.4) for patients who received placebo (n = 73).1 The 12- and 24-month PFS rates in the osimertinib arm were 74% and 65%, respectively. Those respective rates were 22% and 13% in the placebo arm. 3D rendered medical illustration of male anatomy with lung cancer:© Sebastian Kaulitzki- stock.adobe.com “Based on these results, osimertinib will become the new standard of care for patients with [EGFR-mutated], locally advanced NSCLC following definitive chemoradiation. EGFR mutation testing should be conducted for patients with stage III disease in order for patients to achieve optimal outcomes,” lead study author Suresh S. Ramalingam, MD, FACP, FASCO, executive director of Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University and associate vice president for cancer of Woodruff Health Sciences Center in Atlanta, Georgia, said in the press briefing. For patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC, consolidation durvalumab (Imfinzi) is the standard of care after chemoradiotherapy for patients who do not experience disease progression. However, the benefit of durvalumab consolidation is unclear for patients who harbor EGFR mutations, based on a post-hoc analysis from phase 3 PACIFIC trial (NCT02125461), which did not show a significant PFS difference between durvalumab (n = 24) and placebo (n = 11) in patients with EGFR-mutated disease (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.39-2.13).3 Notably, no targeted therapies are currently approved for patients with EGFR-mutated, unresectable, stage III NSCLC.1 LAURA was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled patients at least 18 years of age (or at least 20 years of age in Japan) with locally advanced, unresectable, stage III NSCLC harboring an EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation who did not experience disease progression following definitive chemoradiotherapy.1,4 Patients needed to have a WHO performance status of 0 or 1, and the maximum interval between the last dose of chemoradiotherapy and randomization was 6 weeks.1 Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive 80 mg of oral osimertinib or placebo once per day. Treatment continued until blinded independent central review (BICR)–assessed disease progression per RECIST 1.1 criteria, unacceptable toxicity, or other discontinuation criteria were met. Notably, patients in both arms were permitted to receive open-label osimertinib follow BICR-confirmed disease progression. Tumor assessments were conducted via chest CT/MRI and brain MRI at baseline, then once every 8 weeks until week 48, then once every 12 weeks thereafter until BICR-confirmed progression. Stratification factors included method of chemoradiotherapy (concurrent vs sequential), disease stage (IIIA vs IIIB/C), and location (China vs not China). BICR-assessed PFS per RECIST 1.1 criteria served as the trial’s primary end point. Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), central nervous system PFS, and safety. OS data were immature at data cutoff; however, Ramalingam noted that a trend favoring osimertinib was observed, “[despite] a high proportion of patients crossing over from the control arm [81%].” Additional data showed 22 patients in the osimertinib arm experienced new lesions compared with 68 patients in the placebo arm. Sites of new lesions included the brain (osimertinib, n = 8; placebo, n = 29), lung (n = 6; n = 29), liver (n = 3; n = 7), lymph nodes (n = 1; n = 7), bone (n = 1; n = 1), adrenal (n = 1; n = 0), peritoneum/omentum (n = 1; n = 0), pelvis (n = 1; n = 0), spleen (n = 0; n = 1), and other (n = 1; n = 0). Regarding safety, Ramalingam said findings for osimertinib following chemoradiotherapy were consistent with the known safety profile of the EGFR inhibitor and manageable, noting that most adverse effects (AEs) were not serious, were grade 1/2, and did not lead to treatment discontinuation. The most common any-grade AEs reported in at least 10% of patients included radiation pneumonitis (osimertinib, 48%; placebo, 38%), diarrhea (36%; 14%), rash (24%; 14%), COVID-19 (20%; 8%), paronychia (17%; 1%), cough (16%; 10%), decreased appetite (15%; 5%), dry skin (13%; 5%), pruritus (13%; 7%), stomatitis (12%; 3%), decreased white blood cell count (12%; 3%), pneumonia (11%; 8%), anemia (10%; 4%), and musculoskeletal chest pain (3%; 12%). Grade 3 or higher AEs in the osimertinib arm included pneumonia (3%), radiation pneumonitis (2%), diarrhea (2%), COVID-19 (1%), decreased appetite (1%), dry skin (1%), decreased white blood cell count (1%), and anemia (1%). “The LAURA trial is the first to define the role of EGFR-directed therapy in unresectable stage III disease. While the study did not compare osimertinib to the current standard-of-care immunotherapy, these data have major implications for both patients and oncologists and will change the standard of care for patients with EGFR mutations,” David R.

Patients treated with osimertinib (n = 143) experienced a median PFS of 39.1 months (95% CI, 31.5–not calculable) vs 5.6 months (95% CI, 3.7-7.4) for patients who received placebo (n = 73).1 The 12- and 24-month PFS rates in the osimertinib arm were 74% and 65%, respectively. Those respective rates were 22% and 13% in the placebo arm. 3D rendered medical illustration of male anatomy with lung cancer:© Sebastian Kaulitzki- stock.adobe.com “Based on these results, osimertinib will become the new standard of care for patients with [EGFR-mutated], locally advanced NSCLC following definitive chemoradiation. EGFR mutation testing should be conducted for patients with stage III disease in order for patients to achieve optimal outcomes,” lead study author Suresh S. Ramalingam, MD, FACP, FASCO, executive director of Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University and associate vice president for cancer of Woodruff Health Sciences Center in Atlanta, Georgia, said in the press briefing. For patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC, consolidation durvalumab (Imfinzi) is the standard of care after chemoradiotherapy for patients who do not experience disease progression. However, the benefit of durvalumab consolidation is unclear for patients who harbor EGFR mutations, based on a post-hoc analysis from phase 3 PACIFIC trial (NCT02125461), which did not show a significant PFS difference between durvalumab (n = 24) and placebo (n = 11) in patients with EGFR-mutated disease (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.39-2.13).3 Notably, no targeted therapies are currently approved for patients with EGFR-mutated, unresectable, stage III NSCLC.1 LAURA was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled patients at least 18 years of age (or at least 20 years of age in Japan) with locally advanced, unresectable, stage III NSCLC harboring an EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation who did not experience disease progression following definitive chemoradiotherapy.1,4 Patients needed to have a WHO performance status of 0 or 1, and the maximum interval between the last dose of chemoradiotherapy and randomization was 6 weeks.1 Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive 80 mg of oral osimertinib or placebo once per day. Treatment continued until blinded independent central review (BICR)–assessed disease progression per RECIST 1.1 criteria, unacceptable toxicity, or other discontinuation criteria were met. Notably, patients in both arms were permitted to receive open-label osimertinib follow BICR-confirmed disease progression. Tumor assessments were conducted via chest CT/MRI and brain MRI at baseline, then once every 8 weeks until week 48, then once every 12 weeks thereafter until BICR-confirmed progression. Stratification factors included method of chemoradiotherapy (concurrent vs sequential), disease stage (IIIA vs IIIB/C), and location (China vs not China). BICR-assessed PFS per RECIST 1.1 criteria served as the trial’s primary end point. Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), central nervous system PFS, and safety. OS data were immature at data cutoff; however, Ramalingam noted that a trend favoring osimertinib was observed, “[despite] a high proportion of patients crossing over from the control arm [81%].” Additional data showed 22 patients in the osimertinib arm experienced new lesions compared with 68 patients in the placebo arm. Sites of new lesions included the brain (osimertinib, n = 8; placebo, n = 29), lung (n = 6; n = 29), liver (n = 3; n = 7), lymph nodes (n = 1; n = 7), bone (n = 1; n = 1), adrenal (n = 1; n = 0), peritoneum/omentum (n = 1; n = 0), pelvis (n = 1; n = 0), spleen (n = 0; n = 1), and other (n = 1; n = 0). Regarding safety, Ramalingam said findings for osimertinib following chemoradiotherapy were consistent with the known safety profile of the EGFR inhibitor and manageable, noting that most adverse effects (AEs) were not serious, were grade 1/2, and did not lead to treatment discontinuation. The most common any-grade AEs reported in at least 10% of patients included radiation pneumonitis (osimertinib, 48%; placebo, 38%), diarrhea (36%; 14%), rash (24%; 14%), COVID-19 (20%; 8%), paronychia (17%; 1%), cough (16%; 10%), decreased appetite (15%; 5%), dry skin (13%; 5%), pruritus (13%; 7%), stomatitis (12%; 3%), decreased white blood cell count (12%; 3%), pneumonia (11%; 8%), anemia (10%; 4%), and musculoskeletal chest pain (3%; 12%). Grade 3 or higher AEs in the osimertinib arm included pneumonia (3%), radiation pneumonitis (2%), diarrhea (2%), COVID-19 (1%), decreased appetite (1%), dry skin (1%), decreased white blood cell count (1%), and anemia (1%). “The LAURA trial is the first to define the role of EGFR-directed therapy in unresectable stage III disease. While the study did not compare osimertinib to the current standard-of-care immunotherapy, these data have major implications for both patients and oncologists and will change the standard of care for patients with EGFR mutations,” David R.

Patients with intermediate-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (IR NMIBC) have a high risk of recurrence and need effective therapies to reduce the risk of disease recurrence or progression. This phase 1b study (NCT02720367) assessed the safety and tolerability of TAR-200, an intravesical drug delivery system, in participants with IR NMIBC. Participants with recurrent IR NMIBC were eligible. Participants received either two 7-d or two 21-d TAR-200 dosing cycles over a 4-6-wk period in a marker lesion/ablation design. TAR-200 was placed in the window between the cystoscopy showing recurrent papillary disease and the subsequent complete transurethral resection of the bladder tumour. The primary endpoint was TAR-200 safety. The secondary endpoints included TAR-200 tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy.Twelve participants received TAR-200 treatment. No TAR-200-related serious or grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred. Nine participants had grade ≤ 2 TAR-200-related TEAEs, with urgency, dysuria, and haematuria being most common. Two participants refused a second dosing cycle due to urinary urgency and frequency. Insertion and removal of TAR-200 was successful in all cases. Plasma gemcitabine concentrations remained below the lower limit of detection. Five participants (42%) had complete response (CR): four had pathological CR and one had CR based on visual assessment.TAR-200 appears to be safe and well tolerated, with encouraging preliminary efficacy in participants with IR NMIBC. This study lays the groundwork for the multiple phase 2 and 3 global studies that are currently on-going for TAR-200.In this study, researchers evaluated the safety of the novel drug delivery system TAR-200 in participants with intermediate-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.

Medical records of patients with metastatic UTUC treated with pembrolizumab as second-line therapy were reviewed from 34 institutions in 14 countries. Patients were assessed for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall response rate (ORR). Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to explore the association of variables of interest with OS and PFS. 235 patients were included in our analysis. Median OS was 8.6 months (95% CI 6.6-12.1), the 1 year OS rate was 43% while the 2 years OS rate 29%. The median PFS was 5.1 months (95% CI 3.9-6.9); 46% of patients were alive at 6 months, 34% at 12 months and 25% at 24 months.

They emphasize personalized patient care, starting by understanding patients' goals and risk tolerance. Dr. Porten highlights the importance of discussing radical cystectomy as the gold standard while also considering bladder-preserving treatments depending on the patient's disease characteristics and preferences. Dr. Li stresses the advancements in treatment options, such as pembrolizumab, Adstiladrin, and Anktiva, and the need for effective sequencing of these therapies. They both acknowledge the need for vigilant monitoring and the role of clinical trials in providing more treatment options. They agree that despite new therapies, radical cystectomy remains a primary recommendation, but personalized approaches considering the patient's overall health and treatment preferences are crucial. Biographies:Sima P. Porten, MD, MPH, Urologic Oncologist, Department of Urology, University of California, San Francisco, CARoger Li, MD, Urologist, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL Ashish Kamat, MD, MBBS, Professor of Urology and Wayne B. Duddleston Professor of Cancer Research, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX Ashish Kamat: Hello everyone and welcome to UroToday's Bladder Cancer Center for Excellence. I'm Ashish Kamat, and I'm here in San Antonio for AUA 2024. It's a pleasure to welcome to the URO Today Studios, Sima Porten and Dr. Roger Li, who are no strangers to this forum. So welcome back.Roger Li: Thanks for having us.Sima Porten: Thanks for having us.Ashish Kamat: So I hope you're having a great AUA, and of course, we have the debate that you are participating in tomorrow at the forum where it comes to BCG-unresponsive disease and how much therapy is safe for the patient, how long we can wait, et cetera, et cetera, right? And that's a debate tomorrow. Today, let's hear both of your thoughts on how you approach your discussion with a patient that has BCG-unresponsive disease when you see him or her in your clinic. So Sima, if I could ask you, here's a patient with BCG-unresponsive disease, fits all the FDA-required definitions as closely as possible, and is asking you, ""Hey, Dr. Porten, do I need a radical cystectomy? Can I try something?"" What's your thought process when you're counseling this patient?Sima Porten: Yeah, I think I start with something from the patient about what's their big goal? What's their life look like? What are they looking forward to? What are they into? What are they doing? And that kind of helps the conversation of figuring out, because when you ask if something is safe, it's really about trying to estimate risk for somebody. And everybody has a different line or threshold for that risk, each person, each physician. And so I think that sets the stage with looking from the patient perspective where they kind of fall along that continuum. And then I think you can look at some disease characteristics. You can look at not all BCG-unresponsive recurrences or created equal. There's your small high-grade Ta, and there's your high-volume, high-grade T1, which you in your own mind would risk stratify a little differently as a clinician and try to put that in perspective for a patient. So I think by and large, you can start the conversation by saying that radical cystectomy is considered the gold standard for these reasons because it's definitive and can be curative. However, bladder preservation I know is important for a lot of reasons, and I do think we can try something else safely, but let's talk about that and define what safe means to you.Ashish Kamat: And that's a great point you bring up because every patient has a different threshold. Some patients are like, ""I just want to get this bladder out if you tell me that's the only safe thing."" And some patients are like, ""Dr. Porten, if you tell me this is safe for me, I'm willing to try X, Y, Z things."" So Roger, when a patient comes to you and says, ""Well, I have this disease, my referring doctor has told me I need a radical cystectomy."" How do you go about resetting that expectation in the patient's mind? That the radical cystectomy, yes, it's in the guidelines. It's something we all recommend, but it's not the only option.Roger Li: Right, yeah. So first of all, I'm so glad to see so much activity that's being done in the BCG-unresponsive setting. Just over the last few years, as you know, there's so many different agents that are not only being investigated but also being approved by the FDA now. So as you know, we have three different approved agents in this disease phase, pembrolizumab, Adstiladrin, and also now ANKTIVA, and with a lot of other agents that are right on their tails as we witnessed from the plenary session yesterday with the TAR-200 product and also cretostimogene following very closely on their heels. So I think it's a very exciting time for patients, but also for us as their treating physicians to have such a plethora of different options to offer patients. The other thing that I wanted to mention is as we're kind of treating this BCG-unresponsive disease, as urologists, we're really becoming more familiar with this disease entity. Whereas before, we were always taught that once patients have high-grade recurrence after BCG, then the next step really is cystectomy and there are no other options. We're beginning to understand that with some of these diseases, as Sima had pointed out, you can potentially treat them with additional bladder-sparing agents. And I think from the patient's perspective, certainly to hear that is very welcome because, for obvious reasons, they want to keep their bladders.Ashish Kamat: Yeah, so the point there is really, it goes back to the trial design with pembrolizumab and nadofaragene. At that time, when the BCG-unresponsive paradigm was adopted by the FDA, and of course Merck and Ferring at that time or FKD were developing these trials, we, as a community, did not feel that safe about sparing the bladders. We knew you could do it, but it wasn't safe, which is why if a patient had a recurrence or did not respond, they came off the study, they couldn't get re-dosed, right? But then we've learned that it is safe. These patients are not at harm if you try something else. And obviously, on the other trials with CG, for example, they get re-induced or they get more treatment. Has that changed the way you counsel patients just learning that this re-induction or re-dosing is appropriate? Are you thinking about it differently now, Sima?Roger Li: To some degree, right? I think those trials showed that trying something else is safe when you look at the cystectomy rates and the rate of muscle-invasive disease, and then more importantly, cancer-specific survival. And so all those were very favorable. And so you're like, okay, well one thing was safe, now can I do another thing? So now we're getting into the sequencing question and how would you intelligently sequence this? And because the biomarker aspect is not really there, you're using experience gestalt, you're using things like does somebody have a good enough bladder capacity to even tolerate this next thing? Because if you can't hold the drug, then maybe it's not so safe because it's not being delivered. And so you're trying to now factor in all these other things to help you make a decision on this. But there's no way to tell somebody in, if we treat 100 more patients with the second-line therapy, we'll lose a curative window in X. That number, a lot of people want that, and we don't have that yet.I do think that the data is showing, okay, well we can reinduce, kind of like with BCG, maybe if it didn't work quite as well as you hoped after induction, you can reinduce for certain patients. We're sort of seeing that now in this very different setting. And so I think there is more and more comfort around that. But I also think there's, and I think Roger actually, maybe the two of you actually, have published some of these studies looking at if the patient crosses the line to muscle-invasive disease and then you do the cystectomy, we know that definitely maybe we could impair oncologic outcome there, but where is that line that you step over into muscle invasive all of a sudden? That part is hard to estimate, and I think I'm more comfortable with it, but I also end up being very vigilant on cystos. You see a flat mound, you're like, maybe that's CIS. Maybe there's something deeper. Making sure you sample that right. I worry a lot about upper tract. I mean, I call it, it's not a term, upper tract creep. I worry about that a lot, particularly tumors of the trigone doing that aspect. And so I do image a little more frequently, but I think I'm slowly becoming more comfortable. I still worry.Ashish Kamat: Yeah, no, worrying is important, right?Roger Li: Still worry.Ashish Kamat: And you're referring to the MD Anderson paper that Pat Hensley put out that showed that if a patient gets muscle-invasive disease, progression from non-invasive to invasive, that's worse than the novel muscle-invasive disease. And that's something we all worry about. And that's, I think, why the whole initial trials were so strict. So Roger, share with me your thoughts on how we, as urologists, have become better at TURBTs, at using appropriate urinary markers, whether it's cytology or whatever, at better imaging, our higher definition of scopes. Do you think the BCG-unresponsive disease that we are seeing today in 2023, 2024 is the same as what was looked at in historic data?Roger Li: Yeah, no, absolutely. That's a great point. I think a lot of our fear towards BCG-unresponsive disease is derived from historical data where we don't have the enhanced cystoscopy. We don't have the, even the cross-sectional imaging may be suboptimal. When the disease does come back after BCG, when BCG fails, it's very likely that the patients will actually have progressive disease. And I certainly agree with Sima that preventing progressive disease to muscle invasion and metastatic disease is the number one goal. But in addition to that, I feel like the toxicity, the cumulative toxicity for all of the different lines of treatment is something that we have to keep in mind too.We talk about sequencing because we now have a variety of different agents, and I think, as you know, Ashish, from the IBCG meeting over the last summer, the one thing that did emerge from that was toxicity needs to be front and center in choosing some of these bladder-sparing agents. In that light, pembrolizumab, because it's given IV and because it causes the 15% SAE rate, it's thought to be a little bit less optimal than some of the intravesical agents, and I think that's the way that it should be sequenced in that case. Certainly, we're going to be working on biomarkers that can tell us which patients to use, which agents to choose, and hopefully in the future, we're going to be able to have this paradigm where you're going to have a disease, you're going to have a biomarker, and you're going to have a hunch as to what the biomarker indicates the optimal treatment will be. I think we're going to be closer to that than many of us think.Ashish Kamat: Yeah, I think biomarker-driven identification of which patient and which drug can be matched together is critical. I mean, there's a lot of work going on. You both are leading work in that area, and that's really where we need to go, but we're not there today.Roger Li: Right.Ashish Kamat: So if you have, say, and we didn't talk about gemcitabine and docetaxel, so we have to bring that into the mix because that's what most of us use currently. So let's go on hypotheticals, and I'll ask both of you this and you can agree or disagree, or we could go into nuances. Say you have a Ta high-grade patient that is CIS high-grade with a large tumor, not huge, say three centimeters CIS, and it's BCG-unresponsive and you have, at your disposal, gemcitabine, docetaxel. Let's assume you have no problem with your medical oncologist and pembro is not an issue. Let's assume you have nadofaragene or Adstiladrin as it's called, and let's assume because now it's approved and available that you also have NAI or ANKTIVA, which is its trade name. What's your first choice, second choice? How do you go about that choice as to which drug you would use for a particular patient? Sima?Sima Porten: Yeah, so for the ANKTIVA, I'm going to assume that I don't have a BCG shortage, which is not true because that's going to be my biggest barrier for using that. I would say that in terms of choosing next steps for that patient, I think it will depend a large part on the current state of their bladder and their other comorbidities. So if BCG led to a lot of side effects or they had trouble with tolerance, I'll likely switch to something like gemcitabine-docetaxel probably to begin with, unless their bladder capacity is such that using Adstiladrin would be a better first line because of the very favorable dosing, the once every three months and the volume is less, and so I'll likely use those smaller clinical factors to kind of help decide what should be the front-line treatment.The other really interesting thing with do you do BCG again, plus something kind of comes into play with some interesting data at the EAU from Amanda Myers in your group looking at re-challenge with BCG. I'm not sure how comfortable I would be with re-challenging with BCG, but I certainly would with ANKTIVA if I had the BCG to do so. And so I think it's going to be those small, smaller clinical factors that likely will help me choose therapy. It will be probably the rare patient that would get pembrolizumab as an upfront drug that would probably be at the bottom of the list for me, just because of that AE profile, particularly now that we have three other intravesical options, which have some great results.Ashish Kamat: Yeah, no, I mean again, you're using clinical factors to do the biomarker replacement and personalizing to patients. Do you have a different paradigm? What's your thought process?Roger Li: Yeah, no, I agree with a lot of the things that Sima said, but I think even though we have a lot of options, what we have to keep in mind is that patients are coming in trying to save their bladders in the long term. They're not looking at three-month complete response rates as their end of treatment goals. They're looking at two years, three years, four years, keeping their bladder intact and also disease-free. So I think we have to assess all of the reports and the results from all the ongoing clinical trials and also the previously ran clinical trials in that light. And I think when looked in that light, there really isn't an option currently that has really shifted the paradigm. So I would still say that again, radical cystectomy is the frontline option. For myself, I think I would also try to encourage patients to enroll in clinical trials if it's available because there are a lot of different, very exciting agents that are coming on in the clinical trial space that we can enroll patients on and still have really great efficacy from.Outside of that, I think still gemcitabine and docetaxel, even from the retrospective data, have shown results that are on par with many of the newer agents. And because of the cost to not only the healthcare system but also to the patients themselves. I just found out the other day that one single dose of nadofaragene costs $61,000. And even if the patient's insurance is able to cover 80% of that, that's still a significant amount of money on a quarterly basis that they still have to pay towards their treatment. So especially pitted against the results from those trials, again, I just don't think that the paradigm has really shifted. And so for that reason, I think gemcitabine-docetaxel still might be the de facto treatment to use in that setting.Ashish Kamat: You both raised great points. You have to personalize with the patient and all those factors, and you're absolutely right. Patients don't care what's going to happen in three months. I mean, they want to know at a year, at two years what's going to happen. And if you look at that tail, NAI plus BCG has a nice long duration of response of more than 26 months. Gem Doce has very durable data as well. And of course, the newer drugs, which I didn't mention because they're not approved yet, also look like they have a long duration of response. I think it's wonderful that it's May, it's Bladder Cancer Awareness Month, and we're at the AUA talking about so many drugs. We didn't talk about others, right? Lengene, the non-viral delivery system, I mean, there are so many new agents being looked at and all that. It's just an exciting time for us in the bladder cancer community. In closing, I want to leave you with the opportunity for final closing thoughts on this matter for our audience. I'll let you go first, Roger, and then Sima, you'll have the last word.Roger Li: Thank you. So I think it's exciting times. I totally agree with you, Ashish, that we are really kind of in the beginning of this personalized medicine era in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. It's up to us, Sima, myself, and yourself, to try to figure out which biomarkers fit with which treatment, and for us to also be able to counsel our patients towards the best treatment that's best for them.Sima Porten: Really exciting time, particularly for urologists. We have treatment options for patients and we have tools, good tools in terms of, even though I know it sounds boring, but like a good TURBT, right? That's all in our realm and arena. And I think this is a great time because we, as urologists, get to make an impact in a space where we didn't have a lot of options before. And so I think it's really exciting being able to partner with patients, partner with organizations, bring awareness, and I think it's really going to move the field forward and might help people, which is why we all are doing what we're doing.Ashish Kamat: Absolutely. Thank you again for taking the time, spending it with us today, and thank you to UroToday for giving us this opportunity.Roger Li: Thank you.Sima Porten: Thanks.","The Evolving Role of Radical Cystectomy in the Era of Bladder-Sparing Therapies - Sima Porten & Roger Li Ashish Kamat hosts Sima Porten and Roger Li to discuss the management of BCG-unresponsive bladder cancer.

27,Urology Today_317_Q2_2024,Media,Defining Standard and Extended Pelvic Lymphadenectomy in Bladder Cancer Surgery - Seth Lerner & Siamak Daneshmand,"Defining Standard and Extended Pelvic Lymphadenectomy in Bladder Cancer Surgery - Seth Lerner & Siamak Daneshmand Pat Hensley hosts a discussion on the role of pelvic lymphadenectomy during radical cystectomy for muscle invasive bladder cancer. Joining him are Dr. Seth Lerner and Dr. Sia (Siamak) Daneshmand, who contribute their insights on the evolution of surgical guidelines and the integration of new biomarkers in the treatment of advanced bladder cancer. Dr. Lerner elaborates on the standard and extended lymphadenectomy templates, while Dr. Daneshmand discusses retrospective studies that support the effectiveness of extended lymphadenectomy. They explore the impact of their findings on clinical practices, highlighting the significant survival benefits and potential risks associated with these surgical techniques. The conversation emphasizes the ongoing need for precise, personalized surgical interventions in the management of bladder cancer.

I'm a urologic oncologist at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine, and I'd like to welcome you to today's Uro Today presentation and discussion on the role of pelvic lymphadenectomy during radical cystectomy for muscle invasive bladder cancer. I'd like to welcome our two distinguished guests and colleagues here today. First, Seth Lerner, who is a professor of urology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. And Sia Daneshmand, who is a professor of urology and the SUO Fellowship director at the University of Southern California in LA. Gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.Seth Lerner: Thanks, Pat.Sia Daneshmand: Thank you.Pat Hensley: Both Dr. Lerner and Dr. Daneshmand are thought leaders and have contributed significantly to the field and our understanding of the role of surgery in advanced bladder cancer. They're members of the International Bladder Cancer Group and serve as the former and current Bladder SWOG GU Committee Chairs. So we're honored to have you with us today. I'd like to kick the discussion off by discussing the role of pelvic lymphadenectomy and radical cystectomy, and lymphadenectomy is a staple and a very important part of our extirpative management of muscle invasive bladder cancer during radical cystectomy, it provides both prognostic information and therapeutic value. So I'd like to start with you, Dr. Lerner, if you would, please provide us with some contemporary definitions of what constitutes a template for an extended node dissection versus a standard.Seth Lerner: So the standard, at least as we've defined it in the clinical trial, is complete removal of external internal obturator lymph nodes. The obturator fossa should be completely cleaned out, from the pelvic side wall to the bladder, from Cooper's ligament to the common iliac bifurcation. The extended, now, includes bilateral common iliac presacral, the so-called presciatic fossa, and then certain surgeons will take it up as high as to the inferior mesenteric artery, the root of the artery. So that's at least how we define it in the clinical trial.Pat Hensley: Thanks. Dr. Daneshmand, you've contributed a ton to our understanding of the role of extended lymphadenectomy during radical cystectomy. If you wouldn't mind to just walk me through some of the studies you've been involved in and some of the retrospective literature suggesting that there is a prominent role for an extended pelvic lymphadenectomy during radical cystectomy.Sia Daneshmand: Yeah, thanks, Pat. I think up to now, with Seth's trial, August 1011, and the German LEA trial, all we had was retrospective data, and our standard has been an extended lymph node dissection, which some people call a superextended lymph node dissection up to the IMA, as Seth pointed out. And there's a lot of retrospective data suggesting that pelvic lymphadenectomy makes a difference in terms of comparisons to more limited dissections, showing that survival is better. But it's all retrospective, right? We've also done a lot of mapping studies throughout the years showing where the lymph nodes are located. So we do know that of the patients who have positive lymph nodes, 10, up to 20% in some cases, have nodes above the common iliac bifurcation, and even above the IMA. The real question is, are those therapeutic? Can you remove these lymph nodes and really cure the patients without any further therapy? And yes, I would argue the answer has been yes in very select patients who have lymph node only disease, we have shown, without further therapy, that certain patients are actually cured. But those numbers are small and you really needed this prospective study to see whether we're making a difference as a whole.Pat Hensley: Great, thanks. And that's a perfect segue to the SWOG 1011 trial, which was a phase III surgical randomized controlled trial, randomizing patients to an extended lymphadenectomy versus a standard lymphadenectomy. This is, again, run through SWOG, and Dr. Lerner ran the study. If you wouldn't mind, please provide us with a rationale for the trial, some framework for how the trial was structured, and then some of the key findings.Seth Lerner: Yeah. Sia laid out the rationale beautifully. There was all this retrospective cohort data that suggested a benefit, but it hadn't really been tested prospectively in a randomized trial. The LEA trial, the German trial, hadn't really gotten underway. And so we felt like it would be really important to be able to say, with a high degree of confidence, that the surgeon did a complete standard or standard plus extended, obviously with a one-to-one randomization. One of the key differences between 1011 and the LEA trial is we allowed neoadjuvant, cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy, because SWOG had done the clinical trial demonstrating the benefit of that.And then I think one of the other cool features about the trial was that it was an intraoperative randomization. So eligibility was clinical T2-4a, predominant urothelial, and 0 to N2, and so they were all registered under that. Then intraoperatively, the surgeons were required to examine the extended template, make sure there was no disease there. If there was an enlarged lymph node, they'd send it for a frozen section. If that frozen section was negative, then they could proceed with randomization. If it was positive, the patient did not get randomized; they didn't go on, then the surgeon would do the appropriate operation. And then we required everybody to submit operative and pathology reports and photos for each case, and so we reviewed all of that. And they also had to be fully credentialed. So each of us had to submit five cases, we had a credentialing committee review. This was a select group, high-volume surgeons, high-volume institutions.Pat Hensley: Talk to us about some of the results, if you wouldn't mind, just shed light on what's to be presented and what's coming down the pipe.Seth Lerner: Yeah, we randomized, there were 658 I think registered, we randomized 592, 292 in the extended, 300 in the standard, and six-year follow-up overall, and very similar between the two groups. And the primary endpoint was disease-free survival. We powered it to show a 10 to 12% improvement of extended over standard. And as we've shown now multiple times, the curves are overlapping. There just simply is no difference, both for disease-free survival and overall survival.Pat Hensley: Can you comment on the rate of adverse events and complications with the two?Seth Lerner: Yes. So the short version is a higher rate of grade three through five adverse events, higher mortality rate in the extended versus the standard. Some of those are related to VTEs, sepsis, and so it's really hard to... This is very precisely annotated data, and so there is a risk to doing an extended node dissection. And so in the absence of benefit, for the patients who met the eligibility requirements of the trial, I think it's hard to justify the increased toxicity.Pat Hensley: Well, I want to congratulate you both on your immense contribution to that trial, and I think we can all agree, you provided practice-changing data. Curious as we sit here in 2024, in your practice, is there still a role, even in a subset of high-risk patients perhaps, that you might consider an extended template? And I'll start with you, Dr. Daneshmand.Sia Daneshmand: Sure. Well, let's make something clear. I think all the patients in the trial were high-risk. They had high-grade muscle-invasive disease, T2 to T4a, plus/minus nodes below the common iliac bifurcation. So these were high-risk patients and varying histology, to some degree, was a lot, but had to be predominantly urothelial. So I think it does answer the big question of whether the extended approach makes a difference overall. But I think there are some potential gaps and things that we can maybe agree on that it doesn't answer. We don't know in variant histology; we don't know what happens post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy for the patient who had clinical node-positive disease, whether doing additional lymph nodes in that area and really cleaning that up makes a difference. The German trial, although it was underpowered, probably, to answer some of these questions, the LEA trial led by Gschwend, did show a decrease in pelvic lymph node recurrence rates or cancer-specific survival, particularly actually the SWOG-SN11 showed a bit lower pelvic nodal recurrence, is that correct? You just presented.Seth Lerner: But it's totally opposite of what you would expect.Sia Daneshmand: I know.Seth Lerner: You would think that that would be better with extended.Sia Daneshmand: Well, correct. But we do have better treatments now. We have better systemic treatments. So this is a moving target, right? We are trying to answer a question in a specific time period, and it's a bit of a moving target because we do have... Immunotherapy came along during the SN11 trial, and now of course, we have EV Pembro. So things are, again, in flux and we're going to see. So I still think there's a major role for surgical cure for patients. There's the toxicity of systemic therapies that we need to worry about. Not everybody needs systemic therapies, and I think we need to really start to individualize treatment for patients.Seth Lerner: There are a lot of patients that are not covered in this trial. I think the three of us would agree. So what do you do with N3 disease or N1 nodes? And I suspect that most of us are probably going after those surgically, that would be an extended node dissection. Or the patient who, even though clinical N1, N2 were included in the trial, if you've got persistent measurable disease in the pelvis, I suspect that most of us are probably going to go up at least another level, rather than leave positive nodes behind. But that's not high-level evidence, that's using clinical judgment.Pat Hensley: Maybe Dr. Daneshmand, if you could comment to what degree are we curing a fraction of patients with surgery alone who might have clinical node-positive disease?Sia Daneshmand: So then we have to go back to the retrospective data, and we have over 700 patients in our database with pathological node-positive disease so we do have a lot of data just at USC alone. From that, we can glean that about a third of the patients actually have five-year survival, recurrence-free survival with positive lymph nodes. It's a remarkable number, a third of the patients who you would think are in the highest-risk category. Now the caveat is that many of those have received additional therapies, but some have not. We have patients with para-aortic pericaval node-positive disease, a small fraction of them, it's less than 10% of them, who are cured by the surgery. And those are the special patients I think we need to focus on, those whose bladder cancer, for whatever reason, travels through the lymph nodes. And this is an extension of this idea that even up to the renal hilum, for some patients, with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we've gone back and done a metastasectomy, if you will, on patients who recurred in the nodal basin between the IMA, for instance, because we did extend it, and the renal. Beyond the renal, I really think they have systemic disease. But again, very, very few patients, but I think there is a subset who don't have hematogenous spread and really have lymph node-only disease. Those patients behave differently. Their disease is more indolent. You see, from scan to scan, their lymph node grew by three millimeters, and we would never operate until we see that slow progression or indolent disease. And then varying histology where perhaps we don't have the same efficacy of systemic therapy, maybe that's a place for more extended node dissection. So I think there are some other questions that need to be answered, but for the most part, we do have our answer, I think today.Seth Lerner: I suspect that both of us, all three of us, would probably agree that we don't want to go backwards and say no dissection, or I've heard people bring that up. And it's really important to go back decades to a time when they weren't doing lymph node dissections and the local pelvic recurrence rate was 30 to 40%. So, you saw in the data that I presented today, let's say on average about 10%. So what you pointed out at the beginning, a good thorough pelvic standard node dissection also accomplishes local pelvic control. I think we know that patients who have a local pelvic recurrence generally don't have good outcomes. So I think that's another real benefit of the operation.Pat Hensley: Well, Dr. Daneshmand, Dr. Lerner, I want to thank you both for your enormous contributions specifically to this important topic in bladder cancer management. And I'd like to thank you all for joining us today for this Uro Today session, discussing the role of pelvic lymphadenectomy in radical cystectomy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer, live from AUA 2024 in San Antonio.

28,Urology Today_350_Q2_2024,Media,BRCA2 and Beyond: Unraveling Genetic Drivers of Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness - Hiba Khan,"BRCA2 and Beyond: Unraveling Genetic Drivers of Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness - Hiba Khan Andrea Miyahira talks with Hiba Khan about her presentation on germline genetic associations in prostate cancer. Dr. Khan's study, leveraging data from Invitae, explores genetic testing results linked to medical records to identify gene-specific associations and potential disparities in testing among diverse populations. Key findings reveal that BRCA2 is the most common mutation across all demographics and is associated with advanced disease, while BRCA1 and MMR mutations are often linked to less aggressive prostate cancer and detected before diagnosis. Notably, only 25% of patients had a documented family history prompting genetic testing, underscoring the need for broader screening based on personal cancer history. Dr. Khan emphasizes the importance of large, inclusive studies to ensure equitable access to genetic testing and targeted therapies, aiming to improve outcomes and address disparities in prostate cancer care. Biographies:Hiba Khan, MD, MPH, GU Medical Oncologist, Assistant Professor, Hematology/Oncology Fellow, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, University of Washington, Seattle, WAAndrea K. Miyahira, PhD, Director of Global Research & Scientific Communications, The Prostate Cancer Foundation Andrea Miyahira: Hi everyone. I'm Andrea Miyahira here at the Prostate Cancer Foundation. Joining me today is Dr. Hiba Khan, an associate professor at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. Dr. Khan just presented a poster at ASCO on germline genetic associations in a large prostate cancer cohort. Dr. Khan, thanks so much for joining us today.Hiba Khan: Thank you for having me. I'm so happy to be here.Andrea Miyahira: Prostate cancer is one of the most heritable types of cancer, with over 50% having a genetic component. Many DNA repair mutations have been identified in the germline, most commonly BRCA2, and this has led to recommendations for all patients with advanced or aggressive prostate cancer to receive germline testing. This is important so that patients can know whether they're eligible for PARP inhibitors, but also to trigger cascade genetic testing. So, what were you specifically looking at in this study?Hiba Khan: In this study, we wanted to take advantage of a large database that was available to us through Invitae, which is one of the largest companies that does germline genetic testing commercially. They had great linkage with a medical records database that allowed us to access coding records along with genetic testing results, and there was a linkage between them. The idea for the study was to see if we could identify some gene-specific associations, including things like population trends, demographic trends, and perhaps geographic distributions that could give us some idea of populations that were perhaps being left behind in testing or to get a broader equity, diversity lens to see where we can make the most impact for the most populations.Andrea Miyahira: Okay, thank you. Can you describe the patient cohort, including the racial and ethnic demographics, how patients were selected, and how germline testing was done?Hiba Khan: Yes. This was commercial testing, so they had results for most of the genetic testing that they had done. Any patient that had a prostate cancer code and had undergone genetic testing was included in the cohort. The cohort was predominantly an older population. The median age was 64. The patients were primarily of white background; 66% were white. We had 11% Black or African American ancestry, and about 4% were Hispanic or identified as Latino.Andrea Miyahira: What were your major findings on pathogenic germline alterations? Was there anything that surprised you?Hiba Khan: Yes, the major finding was, I would say, not a surprising one, which, as you stated earlier, BRCA2 is known to be a very common heritable mutation that can serve as a driver for prostate cancer. And so that was the most common mutation we found across all racial ethnic groups and geographic distributions. We also found that BRCA2 was associated with more advanced and metastatic disease, also not a surprising finding.There were a couple of findings that were interesting to me. One of those was that patients with BRCA1 and MMR mutations actually tended to have less aggressive disease. In addition, those patients with BRCA1 and MMR gene mutations, many of them were screened before their prostate cancer diagnosis. So they were found to have had these mutations and then later subsequently developed prostate cancer. So those two things in combination make me think: were those patients perhaps getting screened for prostate cancer more than the average population? Those were a couple of surprising findings. The other major finding was that only a quarter, or 25%, of our patients in the cohort had a code for family history of prostate cancer, which drove the genetic testing. The rest of the patients were screened based on only personal history of prostate cancer.Andrea Miyahira: Okay, thank you. We've seen in studies from Asia that driver alterations can be significantly different than studies performed in predominantly European ancestry populations. So what was the frequency of Asian and other underrepresented populations in this study?Hiba Khan: We did not actually have a very large Asian cohort. Only about 2% of our patients in the cohort were Asian. So it was very difficult to sort of make gene-specific associations and find those trends in the Asian population. What is interesting, though, is that about 10% of the cohort had an unclear race. They were either unknown or it was left completely blank. So I wonder if some of those patients were perhaps other minorities that we weren't capturing. It could include Asian populations, it could have been Native American populations or patients of mixed race ancestry and background that we're not capturing.So, again, it drives home the importance of conducting these kinds of large population-based studies and including race, ethnic background, and similar information so that we can see what the trends are and be able to intervene appropriately if we see that a population's needs aren't being met, to just ensure equitable, both genetic testing, and as you, again, said earlier, just precision-based treatment with PARP inhibitors and immunotherapy.Andrea Miyahira: Can you contrast germline testing with other methods such as polygenic risk score for identifying patients at risk?Hiba Khan: Yes. I think polygenic risk scores are very interesting, and I think we're learning a lot about how we can use them, again, on a very large population-based level. There's some great work being done currently at Fred Hutch Cancer Center to look at how we can use polygenic risk scores in a large population-based manner. I think we're still learning about them, and I think germline genetic testing can be in concert with polygenic risk scores, and we can use them simultaneously.Andrea Miyahira: And what are you and your team doing next in this study?Hiba Khan: I think it'll be really important, actually, to use that really great data to look at treatments and actually outcomes. That's kind of an interest of mine, is to see if we can identify disparities, can we drive a little bit further and see if there are disparities in treatments or disparities in just large populations like we have to see where if it impacts treatment and outcomes in the future. So I think that's one next step of this study. And then in the future, I think we can use all this information we're gathering to hopefully drive some interventions forward to make cancer care and prostate cancer care in general more equitable.Andrea Miyahira: Thanks. What would be your key take-home messages for patients and providers?Hiba Khan: One thing that was really interesting that we found in this study was only a quarter of patients actually had a family history that was coded for. So again, as the guidelines suggest, it just drives home the importance of doing genetic testing, germline genetic testing based on personal prostate cancer history and risk. My ultimate hope is that the more patients we can get tested and screened, not only will they be eligible, potentially, for precision therapies, but we can also screen their family members and loved ones through cascade testing to hopefully find more people who have these germline genetic mutations to impact screening and ultimately the development of prostate cancer and help make a dent in prostate cancer outcomes.Andrea Miyahira: Okay. Well, thank you so much, Dr. Khan, for joining me. It was really a pleasure.Hiba Khan: Thank you very much.","BRCA2 and Beyond: Unraveling Genetic Drivers of Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness - Hiba Khan Andrea Miyahira talks with Hiba Khan about her presentation on germline genetic associations in prostate cancer.

29,Urology Today_461_Q2_2024,Media,AUA 2024: Optimal TURBT: Do Skilled Urologists Really Need to Perform reTUR for all HG Patients?,"AUA 2024: Optimal TURBT: Do Skilled Urologists Really Need to Perform reTUR for all HG Patients? (UroToday.com) The 2024 American Urological Association (AUA) annual meeting featured the AUA-IBCG Bladder Cancer Forum and a series of presentations by Drs. Jeremy Teoh, Neal Shore, and Badrinath Konety discussing whether skill urologists really need to perform re-TUR for all high-grade patients. As moderator, Dr. Shore started by presenting a case of a 65-year-old patient that presented with a solitary 2 cm papillary lesion with surrounding erythema on the lateral wall. His medical history included a two pack per day smoker for 15 years (quit 15 years ago), but he is now vaping, and he is 20 kg overweight. He previously worked in a steel mill and is now a compliance officer for a pharmaceutical company. He eventually underwent a complete resection TURBT, but had a thin bladder wall, as well as a difficult post-anesthesia recovery. Dr. Shore polled the audience with the following question: “Do skilled urologists really need to perform a re-TUR for all high grade patients?” with the following results: Yes: 28% Only T1: 55% No: 17% Dr. Teoh started by taking the stance of no need for repeat TURBT. From a surgical perspective, CIS and early cancer changes can be subtle, it can be difficult to determine the resection margin based on white light imaging alone, and difficult to ensure a uniform resection at the detrusor muscle level. Thus, the end result is residual disease. According to the AUA guidelines specific to a repeat TURBT, the following statements are made: Guideline statement 12: In a patient with non-muscle invasive disease who underwent an incomplete initial resection (not all visible tumor treated), a clinician should perform repeat transurethral resection or endoscopic treatment of all remaining tumor if technically feasible. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade B) Guideline Statement 13: In a patient with high-risk, high-grade Ta tumors, a clinician should consider performing repeat transurethral resection of the primary tumor site within six weeks of the initial TURBT. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C) Guideline Statement 14: In a patient with T1 disease, a clinician should perform repeat transurethral resection of the primary tumor site to include muscularis propria within six weeks of the initial TURBT. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade B) Dr. Teoh raised several important questions, including (1) Why do we need a second surgery to compensate for the first surgery? (2) Why do we think that a second surgery would be easier than the first surgery? With en bloc resection of specimens, both circumferential and deep resection margins can be inked and assessed, as well as the depth of tumor invasion be ascertained. Importantly, proper staging and complete tumor resection can be achieved: Dr. Teoh was the lead author of a recently published phase 3 randomized trial assessing transurethral en bloc resection versus standard resection of bladder tumors.1 The EB-StaR study was a multicenter, randomized, phase 3 trial conducted in Hong Kong. There were 350 patients with bladder tumor(s) of ≤3 cm recruited from April 2017 to December 2020 and followed up until 1 year after surgery. The primary outcome was 1-year recurrence rate. Overall 276 patients were confirmed to have non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, including 143 patients in the en bloc resection group and 133 patients in the standard resection group. At 1 year, 31 patients in the en bloc resection group and 46 in the standard resection group developed recurrence. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of 1-year recurrence rates was 29% (95% CI 18–37) in the en bloc resection group and 38% (95% CI 28–46) in the standard resection group (p = 0.007): The forest plot shows that patients with 1-3 cm tumors, single tumors, Ta disease, or intermediate risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer had a significant benefit from en bloc resection: Dr. Teoh notes that the modified ERBT study is a phase 2 single arm study using modified en block resection. Key inclusion criteria include bladder tumors >= 3 cm, and assuming a >90% rate of complete resection for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and proper staging for muscle invasive bladder cancer, 30 patients were to be recruited. The primary outcome is complete resection and proper staging of muscle invasive bladder cancer, and the study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04081246). One case example from this trial is as follows: Among 28 cases of modified en bloc resection, one case of prostate cancer was excluded, finding 15 cases of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (with 14 cases of complete resection – 93.3%), and 12 cases of muscle invasive bladder cancer (11 had proper staging of muscle invasive disease at the first surgery – 91.7%). Ultimately 8 patients underwent robotic radical cystectomy, with four patients having T2 disease ultimately having T0 disease on final pathologic staging. The remaining four patients had pT3 disease. Thus, Dr. Teoh notes that modified en bloc resection achieved complete resection of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and proper staging of muscle invasive bladder cancer in 92.6% of cases. Dr. Teoh concluded his portion of the debate with the following thoughts: Conventional TURBT is associated with major limitations Second/repeat TURBT is often offered to compensate for the first surgery In the modern era, with the advancement of MRI, enhanced imaging, and newer surgical approaches, should second/repeat TURBT still be offered? A good surgery is the first and the most crucial step to cure non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and possibly a major step towards bladder sparing approaches for muscle invasive disease Dr. Konety then took the position of yes, all patients should receive a repeat TURBT. The following guidelines offer recommendations for repeat TURBT: AUA: Incomplete resection (Grade B) All T1 lesions (Grade B) Recurrence high grade Ta lesions (Grade C) ICUD: Incomplete initial resection T1 high grade disease after a complete initial resection High grade Ta tumors, particularly those that are large or multifocal EAU (Grade A): Incomplete resection Absence of muscle on the first resection (except CIS/low grade Ta) All high grade Ta and T1 lesions NCCN: Incomplete resection T1 Large and multifocal No muscle in the initial specimen with high grade Ta The quality of TURBT likely is related to the person performing the TURBT. Previous studies suggest that tumor at the time of re-TURBT is 4x higher with residents versus expert consultants. Additionally, seminal work from Dr. Harry Herr previously noted that on re-TURBT, 29% of non muscle invasive bladder cancer was upstaged, and 22% of muscle invasive bladder cancer was downstaged. A subsequent systematic review from Cumberbatch et al.2 identified 31 studies including 8,409 patients with high grade Ta and T1 bladder cancer. Detrusor muscle was found at initial TURBT histology in 30-100% of cases, and residual tumor at re-TURBT was found in 17-67% of patients following Ta and in 20-71% following T1 cancer. Most residual tumors (36-86%) were found at the original resection site, and upstaging occurred in 0-8% (Ta to ≥T1) and 0-32% (T1 to ≥T2) of cases. There was no clear relationship between re-TURBT and progression for Ta disease, although T1 rates were higher in the non-re-TURBT group in series with control populations. Overall mortality was slightly reduced in the re-TURBT group in two studies with controls (22-30% vs 26-36% no re-TURBT). Dr. Konety notes that a previous randomized controlled trial from 2010 published updated findings in 2020 with long term follow-up.3 This trial randomized 210 patients with stage pT1 non-muscle invasive bladder cancer who underwent a first TURBT into two groups including second TURBT (n = 105) and no second TURBT (n = 105). Over a median follow-up of 119 months (IQR 65-168), compared to patients without second TURBT, patients with second TURBT had significantly higher 5-year, 7-year and 10-year rates for recurrence free survival (59.4%, 57.9%, and 54.8% vs. 36.3%, 31.7%, and 26.8%, respectively, p < 0.001) and progression free survival (93.3%, 91.9% and 90.4% vs. 74.0%, 71.4% and 68.5%, respectively, p < 0.001): Is a restaging TURBT necessary in high-risk NMBIC if the initial TURBT was performed with blue light? Dr. Konety was part of a study that sought to answer this question using a multi-institutional Cysview registry between 2014 and 2021 of all consecutive adult patients with known non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (Ta and T1 disease) who underwent TURBT followed by a restaging TURBT within 8 weeks.4 Overall, 115 patients had TURBT followed by a restaging TURBT within 8 weeks of which those that underwent blue light compared to white light for their initial TURBT had higher rates of benign pathology on restaging TURBT, although this was not statistically significant (47% vs. 30%; p = 0.08). Of patients with residual tumors on restaging TURBT, there were no differences in rates of Ta (22% vs. 26.5%; p = 0.62), T1 (22% vs. 26.5%; p = 0.62), or CIS (5.5% vs. 13%; P = 0.49) when the initial TURBT was done using blue light compared to white light. As follows are the rates of upstaging on re-TURBT stratified by initial pathology: Historical studies also suggest that re-TURBT also predicts response to BCG, with residual tumor on re-TURBT being a key factor for recurrence (none: 11% vs residual: 28%) and progression (none: 5% vs residual: 17%). Dr. Konety concluded his portion of the debate supporting re-TURBT with the following conclusions: There is more complete information up front with re-TURBT There is better patient selection for BCG It drives better cystectomy decision making It improves disease related outcomes It may improve overall survival En bloc resection samples the detrusor muscle in small tumors, but if what if there is no detrusor? It does not solve the issue if there is tumor found on re-TURBT Moderator: Neal Shore, MD, FACS, Caroline Urologic Research Center, Myrtle Beach, SC Debaters: Jeremy Teoh, MBBS, FRCSEd, FCSHK, FHKAM, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Badrinath Konety, MD, Allina Health Cancer Institute, Minneapolis, MN Written by: Zachary Klaassen, MD, MSc – Urologic Oncologist, Associate Professor of Urology, Georgia Cancer Center, Wellstar MCG Health, @zklaassen_md on Twitter during the 2024 American Urological Association (AUA) Annual Meeting, San Antonio, TX, Fri, May 3 – Mon, May 6, 2024.","AUA 2024: Optimal TURBT: Do Skilled Urologists Really Need to Perform reTUR for all HG Patients?

In the phase 3 JAVELIN Bladder 100 trial, avelumab first-line maintenance + best supportive care significantly prolonged overall survival and progression-free survival from start of maintenance (randomization) vs best supportive care alone in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma without progression after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy (median overall survival, 23.8 vs 15.0 months; HR 0.76, 95% CI, 0.63-0.91; p = 0.0036).1 Moreover, long term safety of maintenance avelumab was demonstrated with no new safety signals. At AUA 2024, Dr. Gupta and colleagues reported post hoc analyses of long-term outcomes by first-line chemotherapy and overall survival from start of first-line chemotherapy. Patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma without progression after 4-6 cycles of first-line cisplatin or carboplatin + gemcitabine were enrolled (n = 700). The trial design for JAVELIN Bladder 100 is as follows: The primary endpoint was overall survival measured from randomization. When stratified by type of chemotherapy received (cisplatin + gemcitabine vs carboplatin + gemcitabine), baseline characteristics were well balanced between those receiving avelumab + best standard of care vs best standard of care alone: At the data cutoff (June 4, 2021), median follow-up from randomization was ≥38 months in both arms. In subgroups treated with first-line cisplatin + gemcitabine or carboplatin + gemcitabine, overall survival from the start of avelumab was longer with avelumab + best supportive care vs best supportive care alone: Investigator assessed progression free survival was also longer in the avelumab + best supportive care versus best supportive care alone in both subgroups: 5.7 months vs 2.0 months, HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.446-0.713 (cisplatin + gemcitabine); 3.7 months vs 2.0 months, HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.362-0.640 (carboplatin + gemcitabine). In the overall population, median overall survival measured from the start of first-line chemotherapy in this population without progression after first-line chemotherapy was 29.7 months (95% CI 25.2-34.0) with avelumab + best supportive care and 20.5 months (95% CI 19.0-23.5) with best supportive care alone (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.635-0.921): Assessing overall survival measured from the start of first-line chemotherapy stratified by type of chemotherapy received showed no benefit for avelumab maintenance in the cisplatin + gemcitabine subgroup (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.613-1.024), but did show benefit for avelumab maintenance in the carboplatin + gemcitabine subgroup (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.514-0.920): Long term safety findings were similar in both subgroups: Dr. Gupta concluded her presentation by discussing long-term outcomes from JAVELIN Bladder 100 in subgroups defined by first-line chemotherapy regimen with the following take-home messages: Long-term outcomes from JAVELIN Bladder 100 confirm that avelumab first-line maintenance provides similar overall survival and progression-free survival benefits in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma without progression after first-line cisplatin- or carboplatin-based chemotherapy Long-term safety of first-line avelumab maintenance was similar in patients who had received first line cisplatin or carboplatin based chemotherapy The median overall survival measured from start of chemotherapy (median 29.7 months) further supports the use of avelumab first-line maintenance as standard of care in this setting and provides a benchmark for future clinical trials Presented by: Shilpa Gupta, MD, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH Written by: Zachary Klaassen, MD, MSc – Urologic Oncologist, Associate Professor of Urology, Georgia Cancer Center, Wellstar MCG Health, @zklaassen_md on Twitter during the 2024 American Urological Association (AUA) Annual Meeting, San Antonio, TX, Fri, May 3 – Mon, May 6, 2024.","AUA 2024: Avelumab First-Line Maintenance for Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma: Long-Term Outcomes from JAVELIN Bladder 100 in Subgroups Defined by First-Line Chemotherapy Regimen and Analysis of OS from Start of First-Line Chemotherapy (UroToday.com) The 2024 American Urological Association (AUA) annual meeting featured a session on invasive bladder cancer, and a presentation by Dr. Shilpa Gupta discussing long-term outcomes from JAVELIN Bladder 100 in subgroups defined by first-line chemotherapy ...","[': Long - Term Outcomes from JAVELIN Bladder 100 in Subgroups Defined by First - Line Chemotherapy Regimen and Analysis of OS from Start of First - Line Chemotherapy ( UroToday. com ) The 2024 American Urological Association ( AUA ) annual meeting featured a session on invasive', ', and a presentation by Dr. Shilpa Gupta discussing long - term outcomes from JAVELIN Bladder 100 in subgroups defined by first - line chemotherapy']","['bladder cancer', 'Urothelial Carcinoma', 'AUA 2024 : Avelumab First - Line Maintenance for Advanced']",[],Overall Survival (OS),0.33381637930870056,"{'Overall Survival (OS)': 0.33381637930870056, 'General Opinion': 0.168595090508461, 'Others': 0.16406100988388062, 'Safety-Side Effects': 0.11347482353448868, 'Safety-General': 0.1128096878528595, 'Efficacy-General': 0.0770004615187645, 'Progression Free Survival (PFS)': 0.030242586508393288}",neutral,0.9259811043739319,,,,,,,neutral,0.9259811043739319,,,,,rocky07,2025-09-03 20:52:18,BioBERT+BART+RoBERTa (GPU-accelerated),mps

CHICAGO — Treatment of with an investigational chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy showed an acceptable safety profile and produced durable remissions among certain patients with non-Hodgin lymphoma. Results from the first-in-human trial, presented at ASCO Annual Meeting, could end up influencing the expansion and effectiveness of huCART19-IL18, according to researchers. Data derived from Svoboda J, et al. Abstract 7004. Presented at: ASCO Annual Meeting; May 30 – June 4, 2024; Chicago. “When using armored [chimeric antigen receptor T cells in patients with lymphoma], targeting CD19 again after prior anti-CD19 CAR failure can be an effective strategy, resulting in durable responses,”Jakub Svoboda, MD,an associate professor of medicine at Abramson Cancer Center at University of Pennsylvania, said during a presentation. “Preliminary correlative studies suggest that [interleukin-18] enhances CAR T-cell therapy efficacy through intrinsic/extrinsic mechanisms.” Background and methodology A percentage of patients with relapsed or refractorynon-Hodgin lymphomasdo not receive long-term benefit from existing anti-CD19 CAR T cells. Researchers attempted to enhance therapeutic efficacy by engineeringhuCART19-IL18— a fourth generation 4-1BB anti-CD19 construct — armored with the ability to secrete the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-18 (IL-18). This study served as a first-in-human trial using huCART19-IL18 for CD19-positive B-cell malignancies. Eligible patients for the non-Hodgkin lymphoma cohort included those who experienced disease relapse after treatment with CD19-directed CAR-T or those who are refractory to CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy. As of Jan. 20, 2024, data cutoff date, 21 patients (median age, 64 years; range, 47-74; 76% men) with CD19-positive NHL received huCART19-IL18 infusions. The heavily pretreated study population — 38% of whom had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma — received a median 7 prior lines of therapy.

CHICAGO — Treatment of with an investigational chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy showed an acceptable safety profile and produced durable remissions among certain patients with non-Hodgin lymphoma. Results from the first-in-human trial, presented at ASCO Annual Meeting, could end up influencing the expansion and effectiveness of huCART19-IL18, according to researchers. Data derived from Svoboda J, et al. Abstract 7004. Presented at: ASCO Annual Meeting; May 30 – June 4, 2024; Chicago. “When using armored [chimeric antigen receptor T cells in patients with lymphoma], targeting CD19 again after prior anti-CD19 CAR failure can be an effective strategy, resulting in durable responses,”Jakub Svoboda, MD,an associate professor of medicine at Abramson Cancer Center at University of Pennsylvania, said during a presentation. “Preliminary correlative studies suggest that [interleukin-18] enhances CAR T-cell therapy efficacy through intrinsic/extrinsic mechanisms.” Background and methodology A percentage of patients with relapsed or refractorynon-Hodgin lymphomasdo not receive long-term benefit from existing anti-CD19 CAR T cells. Researchers attempted to enhance therapeutic efficacy by engineeringhuCART19-IL18— a fourth generation 4-1BB anti-CD19 construct — armored with the ability to secrete the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-18 (IL-18). This study served as a first-in-human trial using huCART19-IL18 for CD19-positive B-cell malignancies. Eligible patients for the non-Hodgkin lymphoma cohort included those who experienced disease relapse after treatment with CD19-directed CAR-T or those who are refractory to CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy. As of Jan. 20, 2024, data cutoff date, 21 patients (median age, 64 years; range, 47-74; 76% men) with CD19-positive NHL received huCART19-IL18 infusions. The heavily pretreated study population — 38% of whom had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma — received a median 7 prior lines of therapy.

Purpose:There is significant interest in identifying complete responders to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) before radical cystectomy (RC) to potentially avoid removal of a pathologically benign bladder. However, clinical restaging after NAC is highly inaccurate. The objective of this study was to develop a next-generation sequencing-based molecular assay using urine to enhance clinical staging of patients with bladder cancer.Methods:Urine samples from 20 and 44 patients with bladder cancer undergoing RC were prospectively collected for retrospective analysis for molecular correlate analysis from two clinical trials, respectively. The first cohort was used to benchmark the assay, and the second was used to determine the performance characteristics of the test as it correlates to responder status as measured by pathologic examination.Results:First, to benchmark the assay, known mutations identified in the tissue (MT) of patients from the Accelerated Methotrexate, Vinblastine, Doxorubicin, Cisplatin trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:NCT01611662, n = 16) and a cohort from University of California-San Francisco (n = 4) were cross referenced against mutation profiles from urine (MU). We then determined the correlation between MUpersistence and residual disease in pre-RC urine samples from a second prospective clinical trial (The pT0 trial; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:NCT02968732). Residual MUstatus correlated strongly with residual disease status (pT0 trial; n = 44;P= .0092) when MUfrom urine supernatant and urine pellet were assessed separately and analyzed in tandem. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 91%, 50%, 86%, and 63% respectively, with an overall accuracy of 82% for this second cohort.Conclusion:MUare representative of MTand thus can be used to enhance clinical staging of urothelial carcinoma. Urine biopsy may be used as a reliable tool that can be further developed to identify complete response to NAC in anticipation of safe RC avoidance.","Urine Biopsy as Dynamic Biomarker to Enhance Clinical Staging of Bladder Cancer in Radical Cystectomy Candidates.

38,Semantic Scholar_36_Q2_2024,Media,Recurrence score gene axes scores and outcomes by race and ethnicity in the RxPONDER trial.,"Recurrence score gene axes scores and outcomes by race and ethnicity in the RxPONDER trial. 515 Background: Racial inequities in breast cancer outcomes remain a significant healthcare concern. In a previous analysis of the RxPONDER trial by race/ethnicity, we showed that non-Hispanic Black (NHB) women have worse outcomes compared to non-Hispanic Whites (NHW) despite similar 21-gene recurrence scores (RS). The RS is determined by an assay consisting of 16 cancer-related genes involved in invasion, ER and HER2 signaling, and proliferation. To provide a better understanding of the differences in underlying tumor biology amongst different racial/ethnic groups, we analyzed RS gene axes scores amongst each group and associations with outcomes. Methods: A total of 3,102 women were included: Hispanic (15.5%), NHB (4.7%), Asian (9.5%), and NHW (70.2%). The primary outcome was invasive disease-free survival (IDFS). This analysis extends median follow-up from 5 to 7 years and evaluates gene axes scores that are components of the RS by race/ethnicity. Impact of proliferation, ER, GRB7 (HER2), and invasion axes scores on IDFS was evaluated in Cox regression models. Results: There were no differences in RS distribution across racial/ethnic groups, and RS remained prognostic for each group with no significant variation in RS prognostic value. However, NHBs were noted to have significantly higher proliferation axis scores than NHWs (p<0.001); HER2 axis scores was higher for Asians than NHWs (p<0.001); and Hispanics had both higher HER2 (p=0.002) and proliferation (p=0.02) axes scores compared to NHWs. These results remained statistically significant after adjusting for age. Relative to NHWs, IDFS was worse for NHBs (HR 1.41; 95% CI 0.98-2.03) and better for Asians (HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.43-0.91) in unadjusted analysis. Adjusting for treatment arm, age, grade, menopausal status, proliferation, ER and HER2 axes scores attenuated the impact of race on IDFS for NHBs (HR 1.22; 95% CI 0.84-1.76), although the findings were unchanged for Asians (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.44-0.93; Table). In a multivariable model, proliferation axis (HR 1.56; 95% CI 1.35-1.80) and ER axis (HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.71-0.93) were prognostic for IDFS. Conclusions: RS gene axes scores differ by race/ethnicity with higher proliferation axis scores noted in NHBs, which could partially explain their inferior outcomes noted in RxPONDER. These findings suggest that tumor biology is indeed important, however, we must dig deeper to uncover intricate factors that contribute to disparities, which is key to designing comprehensive strategies to address them.

Following pregnancy and lactation, breast remodels to near pre-pregnancy stage through apoptotic cell death and adipocyte repopulation process. Long-term breastfeeding and gradual weaning of an infant leads to gradual involution (GI) of the breast, while lack of or abrupt discontinuation of breastfeeding after birth leads to abrupt involution (AI), when rapid and massive cell death takes place. Our studies have shown several precancerous changes, such as increased collagen deposition, inflammation, and hyperplasia in the mammary gland of mice after AI. However, the systemic impact of AI and how this increases risk of breast cancer is yet to be elucidated. Objectives: Our objective is to evaluate the systemic effects that are prompted by the AI mammary gland. We hypothesize that AI leads to marked alteration in lipid metabolism and systemic inflammation that enhances risk for breast cancer. Methods: FVB/n mice (8week old) were paired for breeding. At partum (day 0), dams were randomized to AI or GI cohort and standardized to 6 pups. AI mice had pups removed on day 7 postpartum (ppm) to mimic short-term breastfeeding. For GI mice 3 pups each were removed on day 28 and 31ppm to mimic gradual weaning. Tissues harvested on day 28, 56, and 120 postpartum. Body composition was measured by echo MRI. Glucose tolerance test (GTT) was performed after a 6 hour fast using a 2g/kg glucose intraperitoneal injection. Blood glucose was measured by glucometer. Serum insulin was analyzed by ELISA. HOMA-IR was calculated using blood glucose and serum insulin results. Serum was analyzed using multiplex ELISA by MesoScale Diagnostics. Mammary glands were subjected to untargeted lipidomics. Results: There were no significant differences in body weight, percent body fat or lean mass between AI and GI groups at any time point. However, at day 120 ppm (4 months after partum), we have observed significantly larger amount (1.29-fold increase) of perigonadal adipose tissue (visceral adipose) in AI mice than GI mice (p=0.0112; n=24-38/group). There were no significant differences in blood glucose, serum insulin, HOMA-IR, or GTT results between AI and GI groups at day 120. AI mice had significantly higher levels of cytokines IL-1β (3.1-fold increase, p=0.0417) and KC/GRO (1.5-fold increase, p=0.0196) than GI mice at day 120. At day 28, AI mammary glands had significantly higher amounts of level 3 identified oxidized ceramide containing sphingolipids that were linked to insulin resistance and diabetes. At day 56, GI mammary glands had significantly higher amounts of level 2 and 3 identified metabolites linked to cellular signaling and lipid metabolism. On day 120, there were no significant differences in lipid metabolites between groups. Conclusion: Although histologically GI and AI mammary glands return to near pre-pregnancy state within a month after partum, our data shows specific lipid changes in the AI mammary gland similar to what has been shown in women with TNBC. Furthermore, AI of the mammary gland leads to systemic effects on adiposity and inflammation that could be key to increased breast cancer risk. Further studies along these lines are in progress to understand the whole-body effects of AI and stratify preventive measures for women who cannot breast feed. Significance: Lack of breastfeeding is more prevalent in African American (AA) women and linked to higher risk of developing aggressive TNBC1. Our novel animal models of AI and GI help to link the impact of AI and systemic changes that may enhance breast cancer risk. In particular, we see an increase in visceral adiposity with AI. Understanding this mechanism will help identify strategies to reduce risk in women who are unable or choose not to breastfeed and ultimately help to reduce TNBC and TNBC-related mortality in AA women.

However, their function and base-resolution stoichiometry remain underexplored. Here, we investigate the transcriptome-wide effect of internal site Nm on mRNA stability. Combining nanopore sequencing with our developed machine learning method, NanoNm, we identify thousands of Nm sites on mRNAs with a single-base resolution. We observe a positive effect of FBL-mediated Nm modification on mRNA stability and expression level. Elevated FBL expression in cancer cells is associated with increased expression levels for 2'-O-methylated mRNAs of cancer pathways, implying the role of FBL in post-transcriptional regulation. Lastly, we find that FBL-mediated 2'-O-methylation connects to widespread 3' UTR shortening, a mechanism that globally increases RNA stability. Collectively, we demonstrate that FBL-mediated Nm modifications at mRNA internal sites regulate gene expression by enhancing mRNA stability.","2'-O-methylation at internal sites on mRNA promotes mRNA stability. 2'-O-methylation (Nm) is a prominent RNA modification well known in noncoding RNAs and more recently also found at many mRNA internal sites.

Introduction:Durvalumab improves survival when used as consolidation therapy after chemoradiation (CRT) in patients with stage III NSCLC. The optimal consolidation therapy for patients with EGFR-mutant (EGFRmut) stage III NSCLC remains unknown.Methods:In this multi-institutional, international retrospective analysis across 24 institutions, we evaluated outcomes in patients with stage III EGFRmut NSCLC treated with concurrent CRT followed by consolidation therapy with osimertinib, durvalumab, or observation between 2015 and 2022. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS, primary end point) and overall survival (secondary end point). Treatment-related adverse events (trAEs) during consolidation treatment were defined using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used.Results:Of 136 patients with stage III EGFRmut NSCLC treated with definitive concurrent CRT, 56 received consolidation durvalumab, 33 received consolidation osimertinib, and 47 was on observation alone. Baseline characteristics were similar across the three cohorts. With a median follow-up of 46 months for the entire cohort, the median duration of treatment was not reached (NR) for osimertinib (interquartile range: NR-NR) and was 5.5 (interquartile range: 2.4-10.8) months with durvalumab. After adjusting for nodal status, stage III A/B/C, and age, patients treated with consolidation osimertinib had significantly longer 24-month rwPFS compared to those treated with durvalumab or in the observation cohorts (osimertinib: 86%, durvalumab: 30%, observation: 27%, p < 0.001 for both comparisons). There was no difference in rwPFS between the durvalumab and the observation cohorts. No significant difference in overall survival across the three cohorts was detected, likely due to the limited follow-up. Any-grade trAE occurred in 52% (2 [6.1%] grade ≥3) and 48% (10 [18%] grade ≥3) of patients treated with osimertinib and durvalumab, respectively. Of 45 patients who progressed on consolidation durvalumab, 37 (82%) subsequently received EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Of these, 14 (38%) patients developed trAEs including five patients with pneumonitis (14%; 2 [5.4%] grade ≥3) and five patients with diarrhea (14%; 1 [2.7%] grade ≥3).Conclusions:This study suggests that among patients with stage III unresectable NSCLC with a sensitizing EGFR mutation, consolidation osimertinib was associated with a significantly longer rwPFS compared to durvalumab or observation. No unanticipated safety signals were observed with consolidation osimertinib.","Consolidation Osimertinib Versus Durvalumab Versus Observation After Concurrent Chemoradiation in Unresectable EGFR-Mutant NSCLC: A Multicenter Retrospective Cohort Study.

Purpose:Real-time intrafraction tracking/gating is an integral component of magnetic resonance imaging-guided radiation therapy (MRgRT) and may have contributed to the acute toxicity reduction during prostate stereotactic body radiation therapy observed on the MRgRT-arm of the MIRAGE (MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING-GUIDED Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer) randomized trial (NCT04384770). Herein we characterized intrafraction prostate motion and assessed gating effectiveness.Methods and materials:Seventy-nine patients were treated on an MR-LINAC. Real-time cine imaging was acquired at 4Hz in a sagittal plane. If >10% of the prostate area moved outside of a 3-mm gating boundary, an automatic beam hold was initiated. An in-house tool was developed to retrospectively extract gating signal for all patients and identify the tracked prostate in each cine frame for a subgroup of 40 patients. The fraction of time the prostate was within the gating window was defined as the gating duty cycle (GDC).Results:A total of 391 treatments from 79 patients were analyzed. Median GDC was 0.974 (IQR, 0.916-0.983). Fifty (63.2%) and 24 (30.4%) patients had at least 1 fraction with GDC ≤0.9 and GDC ≤0.8, respectively. Incidence of low GDC fractions among patients appeared stochastic. Patients with minimum GDC <0.8 trended toward more frequent grade 2 genitourinary toxicity compared with those with minimum GDC >0.8 (38% vs 18%, P = .065). Prostate intrafraction motion was mostly along the bladder-rectum axis and predominantly in the superior-anterior direction. Motion in the inferior-posterior direction was associated with significantly higher rate of acute grade 2 genitourinary toxicity (66.7% vs 13.9%, P = .001). Gating limited mean prostate motion during treatment delivery in fractions with a GDC <0.9 (<0.8) to 2.9 mm (2.9 mm) versus 4.1 mm (4.7 mm) for ungated motion.Conclusions:Fractions with large intrafraction motion were associated with increased toxicity and their occurrence among patients appears stochastic.

PURPOSE Early-phase clinical trials (EP-CTs) are designed to determine optimal dosing, tolerability, and preliminary activity of novel cancer therapeutics. Little is known about the time that patients spend interacting with the health care system (eg, time toxicity) while participating in these studies. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the electronic health records of consecutive patients enrolled in EP-CTs from 2017 to 2019 to obtain baseline characteristics and number of health care-associated days, defined as all inpatient and outpatient visits while on trial. We used univariable and multivariable analyses to identify predictors of increased time toxicity, defined as the proportion of health care-associated days among total days on trial. For ease of interpretation, we created a dichotomous variable, with high time toxicity defined as ≥20% health care-associated days during time on trial and used regression models to evaluate relationships between time toxicity and clinical outcomes. RESULTS Among 408 EP-CT participants (mean age, 60.5 years [standard deviation, SD, 12.6]; 56.5% female; 88.2% White; 96.0% non-Hispanic), patients had an average of 22.5% health care-associated days while on trial (SD, 13.8%). Those with GI (B = 0.07; P = .002), head/neck (B = 0.09; P = .004), and breast (B = 0.06; P = .015) cancers and those with worse performance status (B = 0.04; P = .017) and those receiving targeted therapies (B = 0.04; P = .014) experienced higher time toxicity. High time toxicity was associated with decreased disease response rates (odds ratio, 0.07; P < .001), progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 2.10; P < .001), and overall survival (HR, 2.16; P < .001). CONCLUSION In this cohort of EP-CT participants, patients spent more than one-fifth of days on trial with health care contact. We identified characteristics associated with higher time toxicity and found that high toxicity correlated with worse clinical outcomes. These data could help inform patient-clinician discussions about EP-CTs, guide future trial design, and identify at-risk patients.","Time Toxicity Experienced by Early-Phase Cancer Clinical Trial Participants.

However, optimal predictive biomarkers are lacking. We used a plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) signature-based predictive model to assess treatment response and potentially select patients eligible for ICI monotherapy. Methods: 40 plasma samples were collected from adult patients with stage III or IV lung cancer at Houston Methodist Hospital between 2019 and 2022. These were divided into a training (n = 24) and validation (n = 16) set. By identifying genes associated with progression free survival (PFS), a 16-gene signature was used to develop a 5hmC predictive model. A weighted predictive score (wp-score) based on the model was calculated for each patient and grouped into low and high wp-scores. Results: Low wp-scores were associated with higher objective response rate(ORR) in both training and validation set and better correlated with response rates compared to PD-L1. In the training set, PFS was longer in low wp-scores compared to high wp-scores (median 12.3 versus 3.0 months; p = 3.5x10-6; hazard ratio (HR) 4.6x10-10). This was also seen in the validation set (median 7.6 versus 1.8 months p = .0012; HR 0.12). Contrarily, high ( > 1%) or low ( < 1%) PD-L1 was not associated with PFS (median 6.8 versus 6.0 months; p = .40; HR 0.70; 95% CI, 0.30–1.60) or overall survival (OS) (median 10.1 versus 12.0 months; p = .38; HR 0.56; 95% CI, 0.15–2.10). 15 out of the 40 total patients received ICI monotherapy. Among these, low wp-scores (n = 8) were significantly associated with longer PFS compared to high wp-scores (n = 7), (median 19.6 versus 2.8 months; p = .00073; HR: 0.059). OS although longer, was not significant among the two groups (median 38.1 versus 10.5 months; p = .12). Conclusions: Our study provides a proof of concept that cfDNA 5hmC signature can be used to predict response to ICI therapy and select patients appropriate for monotherapy. It is a more sensitive and specific biomarker to PD-L1. Larger studies are underway to further validate cfDNA 5hmC based-signature predictive model.

The types of trials attractive to and successful in the community, however, are likely different from those run primarily at academic centers. We analyzed the characteristics of clinical trials open at a network of community oncology practices across the United States in the last 2 years, in order to inform both sponsors and sites about the studies most well-suited for a community setting. Methods: We analyzed characteristics from every clinical trial entered in OncoTrials, a clinical trial screening and tracking tool utilized exclusively by US community oncology practices, between 9/1/2021 through 10/09/2023 via knowledge of the trial NCT number and data available through API from clinicaltrials.gov. Descriptive statistics, including median and range for continuous variables and percentages for categorical variables are reported. Results: 1,310 clinical trials were open across 64 community oncology practices. Sponsors were classified as 80% industry (n=1,054), 15% NIH (n=195), 1% network (n=13) and 5% other (n=48). 93% of studies were interventional, 5% observational, 1% registry and 1% expanded access. Types of interventional studies (n=1,215) and the number of sites that ran them are shown (Table). The median target enrollment across all studies was 235 patients. Individual trials were open at a median of 2 community practices in our cohort (range 1-22 practices); 521 clinical trials (40%) were open at only one practice and 34 trials (2.6%) were open at more than 10 practices. The mean number of unique trials open at a practice during our 2 year observation period was 54 (median 35, range 1-264). Among these trials, the most commonly associated tumor types were lung (15%), pan-solid tumors (14%), breast (11%), lymphoma (6%), colorectal (6%), prostate (5%), gynecologic (4%), bladder (4%), head and neck (4%) and melanoma (4%). Conclusions: Community oncology practices supported a robust portfolio of clinical trials, most commonly focused on treatment of solid tumors. The vast majority were interventional (phase 2-3) and industry-sponsored. Half of sites ran Phase I trials, and Phase IV trials were uncommon but had broad participation across sites. Notably, a large proportion of studies were only open at one single site in a cohort of 64 community oncology practices. This highlights the opportunity for sponsors to leverage networks, consortia, and further research to ensure that appropriate studies are accessible among a broader range of community research sites.

The goal of this series was to help readers better understand how to apply the results of key studies, including those published inJournal of Clinical Oncology, to patients seen in their own clinical practice.The systemic treatment for metastatic urothelial carcinoma has evolved over the past decade; however, changes in the first-line setting have remained elusive and dependent on platinum-based chemotherapy regimens. Hoimes et al now present an update on the results of cohort A of the EV-103 phase Ib/II trial combining enfortumab vedotin and pembrolizumab in the first-line setting for patients with cisplatin-ineligible metastatic urothelial carcinoma. The efficacy results in this small, phase I cohort demonstrate an impressive response rate with the majority of patients deriving benefit in tumor control. In conjunction with the results from cohort K of EV-103, recently reported at the 2022 ESMO Congress, there is much anticipation regarding this combination as a future standard of care. However, despite this combination not including a traditional cytotoxic chemotherapeutic, it is still associated with potentially life-altering treatment-related toxicity, most notably rash and peripheral neuropathy, along with the risks of immune-related adverse events, which will need to be carefully calibrated for patients.","Platinum-Free Systemic Therapy in First-Line Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma: Mirage or Oasis in the Platinum Desert?

We aimed to characterize the genomic and transcriptomic correlates underlying ARX in ICI-treated mRCC patients. Methods: We identified pts with mRCC at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Fox Chase Cancer Center, treated with ICI-based regimens who had an initial response to therapy followed by disease progression. Tissue samples from the primary tumors or metastases were collected before ICI treatment and after ARX from a treatment-emergent escape lesion. Whole exome sequencing (WES) and bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) were performed. Somatic mutations were called using the Cancer Genome Analysis pipeline. Differential gene expression analysis (DGE) was run using DESeq2, followed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Immune cell fractions were estimated using CIBERSORTx. Cell fraction and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) scores were compared between post and pre-ARX samples using the Wilcoxon test. Results: A total of 41 samples (n=23 pre-ARX and n=18 post-ARX) were collected from 14 unique patients. After quality control, WES and RNA-seq data were available for 27 samples (14 pre-ARX and 13 post-ARX) and 9 samples (3 pre-ARX and 6 post-ARX), respectively. No discernable enrichment of gene mutations was detected in the post-ARX setting compared to the pre-ARX. DGE identified 61 downregulated immunoglobulin genes in the post-ARX setting. GSEA revealed significant depletion of pathways associated with B-cell and T-cell function in post-ARX samples (all adjusted p<0.05). Similarly, a trend towards decreased naïve B cell and CD8+ T cell fractions was observed in the post-ARX setting (p=0.17 for both). Three previously reported TLS-associated expression signatures were depleted in the post-ARX samples compared to pre-ARX (p=0.015, p=0.065 and p=0.065, respectively). Immunohistochemistry assessment of 3 samples from one pt using ant-CD3 and CD20 antibodies confirmed the presence of TLS in the pre-ARX sample and their absence in two different post-ARX samples. Conclusions: In our cohort of pts with mRCC, no gene mutations were implicated as drivers of ARX. However, ARX was associated with downregulation of B-cell signaling and humoral mediated immunity, as well as absence of TLS. Ongoing efforts are in progress to include more samples.","Multi-omic characterization of acquired resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. 459 Background: While immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have improved outcomes in patients (pts) with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), acquired resistance (ARX) is commonly encountered.

Residents rotating on inpatient oncology services often care for patients and families nearing the EOL. There is no standardized resident training for EOL care nor are there standardized methods to assist with resultant emotional distress. Studies have demonstrated that residents on hematology/oncology rotations experience acute empathy decline, which can lead to cynicism and depersonalization, contributing to burnout (McFarland, 2016). Our objective was to prospectively evaluate the impact of a structured debriefing session during a 4-week inpatient oncology rotation on residents' concerns about death and rotation satisfaction. Methods: During week 1, residents completed a 10-item Concerns about Dying (CAD) instrument (Mozer, 2004). During week 3, residents participated in a structured 60-minute debriefing session with a clinical psychologist or licensed social worker specializing in hematology-oncology. During week 4, residents completed the CAD and an end-of-rotation self-assessment. Results: 58 individual residents rotated through inpatient oncology at Loyola University Medical Center from 7/2020 – 1/2022. 15 residents were excluded as they did not complete both the pre and post surveys. Trainees had a lower CAD score at the end of their oncology rotation, indicating a more positive attitude towards death and dying. PGY1s had the greatest decrease in CAD score over 4 weeks. Anxiety (70%), relief (70%), satisfaction/pride (63%) and sadness (58%) were the most common emotions residents felt while providing EOL care. 42/43 (98%) residents were comfortable discussing EOL topics with a licensed counselor and 40/43 (93%) felt the debriefing had a positive impact on their rotation. 38/43 residents (88%) believed the debriefing reduced sentiments of cynicism and dissatisfaction caused by emotional distress related to EOL care. Conclusions: Resident concerns about death decreased during a 4-week inpatient oncology rotation in which a structured debriefing program occurred during week 3. Although the study protocol does not provide causation, it suggests the debriefing allowed residents to reflect on EOL care and enhance their ability to cope with distress. The favorable feedback from this pilot led to a permanent curricular change for the inpatient oncology rotation. Strategies to assess and manage emotional strain among residents providing EOL care remain limited and warrant further investigation.[Table: see text]",Impact of structured debriefing sessions on residents rotating on inpatient oncology. 11018 Background: Participating in end-of-life (EOL) care may lead to physician distress and burnout.
